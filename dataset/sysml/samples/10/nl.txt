This system is designed to achieve effective management of fuel flow. It consists of two main components: the fuel tank assembly and the engine. The fuel tank supplies fuel to the engine through a dedicated port, and can also receive excess fuel returned from the engine. Throughout the entire fuel transfer process, temperature information can be detected and transmitted at the interface to ensure the safety and efficiency of fuel supply. Users can obtain real-time data on fuel supply, return flow, and related temperature parameters, enabling visualized monitoring and precise control of fuel flow status. This effectively meets the engine's requirements for fuel management during operation.
