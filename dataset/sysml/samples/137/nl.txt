The system requires the definition of an automotive component model, which includes a vehicle and its front wheels. The vehicle has a mass of 1200 kilograms and a length of 4.82 meters. Each vehicle is equipped with a pair of left and right front wheels. For each wheel, the hub diameter must be specified as 18 inches and the width as 245 millimeters, with the outer diameter of the wheel determined by both the hub diameter and the tire height. In addition, each wheel must be fitted with a tire. All dimensions and units must support both International System of Units (SI) and United States customary units (Imperial) conversions. This model aims to provide fundamental data structures for the standardized design and simulation of automotive parts.
