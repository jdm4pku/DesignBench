This system aims to achieve integrated management of multi-architecture systems, involving communication and collaboration among multiple subsystems and components. The system is decomposed into two main architectural breakdowns:

In the first decomposition, the system is divided into two subsystems: b11 and b12. Subsystem b11 contains components c1 and c2, where c1 and c2 are connected via signal ports, and the interface pe is bound to the pb port of c1. Subsystem b12 contains components c3 and c4, with the interface pf bound to the pd port of c3. Furthermore, communication between b11 and b12 is realized through interfaces pe and pf.

In the second decomposition, the system is assembled via two major modules, b21 and b22. Both b21 and b22 reuse the c-level components defined in a11 by referencing and sharing c1, c2, c3, and c4. This enables the reorganization of signal connections and reuse of ports between modules.

Overall, the design objective of this system is to standardize the interface binding and signal connection among components. Through flexible composition and reuse mechanisms, the system enhances the flexibility and integration efficiency of the overall architecture, meeting the requirements for multi-level component interoperability in complex system architectures.
