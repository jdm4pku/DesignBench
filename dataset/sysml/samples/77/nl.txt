The system is designed to provide end users with a convenient and efficient mode of transportation. It is capable of supporting a driver and up to four passengers sharing a vehicle, enabling them to travel safely and comfortably from the starting point to the destination. Users can freely enter and exit the vehicle, and the system should ensure that this process is simple and smooth. In addition, the system should fully consider and integrate surrounding environmental factors to ensure the safety and sustainability of the entire journey, while also being compatible with related infrastructure such as gas stations. The systemâ€™s operation should be centered on human needs, with a focus on ride experience and various conveniences, assisting passengers and drivers in smoothly completing all kinds of daily transportation tasks.
