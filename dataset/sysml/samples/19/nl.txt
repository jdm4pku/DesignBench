This system is designed to support the photography workflow, enabling the complete process from focusing on a scene to producing the final image. The user first selects or sets a scene to be photographed; the system then automatically performs focusing on the selected scene and generates an intermediate image. Subsequently, the system carries out the shooting operation based on the focused image, thereby outputting the final photograph. The entire workflow is completed sequentially through the two steps of “Focusing” and “Shooting,” ensuring that the image has achieved clear focus before shooting and resulting in high-quality photo output. The system operation process is concise and coherent, enabling users to efficiently obtain the desired photographs.
