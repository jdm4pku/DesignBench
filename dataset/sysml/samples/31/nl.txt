This system is designed to simulate a vehicle with a known mass moving along a one-dimensional straight path, predicting its position over time based on a given time-varying power input sequence. Users are required to provide the vehicle's mass, initial position, initial velocity, the time interval of each simulation step, as well as the power input at each time step. The system sequentially calculates the vehicle's speed and position at each moment according to the input data, and outputs the trajectory of the vehicle's position at each time step. This helps users analyze the vehicle's motion behavior under different power inputs.
