This system is designed to model and compute the vehicle's driving dynamics. Based on user input parameters such as vehicle mass, wheel power, aerodynamic drag coefficient, and rolling resistance coefficient, together with initial speed and position, the system automatically calculates and updates the vehicle's speed and position at each time step. The system comprehensively accounts for the effects of air resistance and frictional resistance on vehicle dynamics and uses this information to predict the vehicle's velocity, acceleration, displacement, and other dynamic states over time. This assists end users in analyzing vehicle performance under different operating conditions, thereby enabling the automation and efficient management of vehicle dynamics simulation.
