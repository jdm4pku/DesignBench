The system needs to support the management of several core data types, including unsigned integers and unsigned floating-point numbers, both of which must be non-negative. The system should also be capable of handling basic data types such as date-time, string, and boolean values. The system must provide color labeling for status conditions, with “red”, “yellow”, and “green” respectively representing different status levels (e.g., severity levels such as critical, warning, and normal), and automatically associate each level with the corresponding color. The system should also be able to describe physical dimensions, in particular, support a diameter parameter measured in millimeters, with selectable options of “Small (60 mm)”, “Medium (70 mm)”, and “Large (80 mm)”, and a default initial value set to Small. Overall, the system’s data types should be designed for future extensibility and ensure correct enforcement of value constraints and the logic that associates statuses with their corresponding colors.
