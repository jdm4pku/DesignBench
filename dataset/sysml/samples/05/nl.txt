The traffic signal system includes a traffic signal component that represents the current color state of the traffic light, with the colors being green, yellow, and red. Additionally, the system defines a specific traffic signal component that is in the green state, indicating that it is always in the "go" state. The above model supports the explicit indication of the traffic light's color, helping to facilitate orderly traffic flow and management.
