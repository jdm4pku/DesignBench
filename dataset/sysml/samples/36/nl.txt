This system is primarily used to manage the operational status of a vehicle, enabling the vehicle to automatically switch states according to different control signals. When entering the system for the first time, the vehicle is in the "off" state. If a "VehicleStartSignal" is received at this time, the system will switch to the "starting" state. Next, upon receiving a "VehicleOnSignal," the system will enter the "on" (running) state. During vehicle operation, as soon as a "VehicleOffSignal" is received, the vehicle status will return to the "off" state. This entire process realizes automatic state management from shut down, through starting, to running, and then back to shut down, allowing users to comprehensively control and monitor the vehicle.
