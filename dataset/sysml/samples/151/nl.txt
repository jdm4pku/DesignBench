This system is designed to provide transportation services for users. Users (the driver and up to four passengers) can enter the vehicle, and the driver is responsible for operating the vehicle to complete travel tasks. During vehicle use, if the fuel level falls below 10% of the maximum tank capacity, the driver may go to a gas station to refuel, thus ensuring the vehicle can continue operating. Environmental factors will also be taken into account throughout the process. After transportation is completed, all individuals exit the vehicle safely. This system focuses on facilitating user boarding, timely refueling during the journey, and ensuring the smooth boarding and alighting of passengers and the driver, thereby guaranteeing an efficient and safe travel experience.
