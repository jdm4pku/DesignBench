An airbag should also be installed in the cockpit, but its application is not mandatory. Additionally, an anti-theft alarm device should be installed inside the vehicle to enhance security protection. The vehicle body must be equipped with a bumper, which is a required safety component, and is also required to have a keyless entry system to improve security performance. The chassis structure is to be fitted with two wheels and equipped with two sets of anti-lock braking systems, although the installation of such braking systems is not mandatory. All the aforementioned components related to safety and security are subject to identification and classification management by the system to ensure compliance with regulations regarding critical safety and security functions, thereby enhancing the vehicleâ€™s overall safety and security features.
