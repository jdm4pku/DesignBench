This system requires the design of a configurable engine, with a basic structure composed of multiple cylinders. The number of cylinders can be either 4 or 6. Each cylinder is available in two diameters: 70 mm and 100 mm, with the specific selection depending on actual requirements. In terms of engine configurations, the system should support at least two engine variants: a four-cylinder engine and a six-cylinder engine. Users can choose the appropriate combination of cylinder quantity and diameter according to different application scenarios, thereby enabling flexible adjustment of engine performance and size.
