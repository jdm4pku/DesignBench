This system is designed to provide flexible solutions for vehicle product line configuration, capable of automatically matching suitable combinations of engines, transmissions, and wheels based on different performance requirements and user preferences. For example, when high performance is required, the system will configure a 6-cylinder engine, automatic transmission, and wide-rim wheels, ensuring compatibility among these components. For standard performance requirements, a combination of a 4-cylinder engine, manual transmission, and narrow-rim wheels is offered. The system enforces a series of configuration constraints to ensure that each configuration scheme meets vehicle performance and component compatibility requirements, preventing unreasonable combinations. Ultimately, it enables customized vehicles tailored to individual user needs. Additionally, the system supports the selection of multiple vehicle model variants, allowing enterprises to quickly respond to market demands and achieve flexible expansion and management of their product lines.
