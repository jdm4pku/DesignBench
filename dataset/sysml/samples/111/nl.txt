This system aims to implement a model of the automobile assembly process, requiring sequential completion of gearbox and engine assembly on the final assembly line. Specifically, the assembly process starts with a vehicle assembly without a gearbox and engine; first, the gearbox is installed onto the vehicle assembly to produce an assembly without an engine, and then the engine is installed onto the vehicle with the gearbox, ultimately forming a fully assembled vehicle. During this process, each assembly step must have clear inputs and outputs, and the fully assembled vehicle should have independent, functional gearbox and engine units, enabling further functionalities such as power delivery. This model focuses on reflecting the sequence of final assembly, the interrelation between assembled components, and the integrity of the complete vehicle after assembly, ensuring the assembly process is standardized, orderly, and efficient, thus meeting the practical requirements of automobile manufacturing and production.
