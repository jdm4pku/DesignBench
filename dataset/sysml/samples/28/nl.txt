This system is designed to implement continuous monitoring and control during the battery charging process. Once charging begins, the system continuously monitors the current battery level (displayed as a percentage). If the battery level is below 100%, it will automatically replenish the battery. This cycle repeats until the battery level reaches or exceeds 100%, at which point the system automatically terminates the charging process. The entire charging operation is fully automated, requiring no manual intervention, thereby ensuring the battery is safely and reliably fully charged while preventing overcharging.
