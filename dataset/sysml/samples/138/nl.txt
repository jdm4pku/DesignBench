This system is used to configure the vehicle's powertrain, including the engine and transmission. The vehicle can be equipped with either a four-cylinder engine or a six-cylinder engine, and can be paired with either a manual transmission or an automatic transmission. Each vehicle must select one type of engine and one type of transmission. If the vehicle is a high-performance model, it must be equipped with a six-cylinder engine; otherwise, a four-cylinder engine must be used. In addition, there are only two valid powertrain combinations: either a four-cylinder engine with a manual transmission, or a six-cylinder engine with an automatic transmission. No other combinations are permitted.
