This system is designed to implement a dynamic connection reference model between a vehicle and a towed trailer. The vehicle section comprises a chassis equipped with a tow ball device; the trailer section includes a trailer chassis and a coupler mechanism. The coupler mechanism is able to engage or disengage with the tow ball through its internal structure. Users should be able to connect and disconnect the trailer to and from the vehicle (i.e., hitching and unhitching operations). When connected, the trailer’s coupler should securely latch onto the vehicle’s tow ball, while disconnection should allow the two to separate smoothly, thereby achieving safe and convenient trailer attachment and detachment functionality.
