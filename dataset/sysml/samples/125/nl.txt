This system is designed to manage and display vehicle safety and security-related features and components, ensuring that users can intuitively understand the safety and security configurations of the entire vehicle and its constituent parts. The vehicle includes components such as seat belts, airbags, and alarm devices. Among these, seat belts and bumpers are mandatory safety features, while airbags and anti-lock braking systems are optional safety features. Additionally, the vehicle is equipped with security devices such as alarms and keyless entry systems. The system is capable of filtering and organizing all vehicle-related components based on safety or security features, and visualizing them in forms such as tree structures or tables. This enables end users to quickly review the safety configurations of the whole vehicle and its sub-systems, clearly distinguishing between mandatory and non-mandatory safety functions, thereby achieving comprehensive management and transparent display of the vehicleâ€™s safety and security features.
