This system is designed to verify vehicle mass compliance to ensure that the actual mass of the tested vehicles does not exceed the specified maximum permissible mass. Specifically, each participating vehicle must have its actual mass measured using weighing equipment operated by a test operator. The system then compares the measured mass with the required value (e.g., a maximum permissible mass of 2,500 kilograms). If the vehicle's actual mass is less than or equal to the strictly defined upper limit, it is considered compliant; otherwise, it is deemed non-compliant. The system supports sequential testing and result determination for multiple vehicles, providing a reliable and automated solution for compliance management of vehicle-related product quality.
