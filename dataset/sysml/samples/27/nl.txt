This system is designed for automatic monitoring and control of the battery charging process, ensuring that the battery can be safely and efficiently fully charged. The battery charging control system needs to monitor the current battery level in real time, automatically supplying charge when the battery level is below 100%; when the battery level reaches or exceeds 100%, the charging process is automatically terminated without manual intervention. The core functions of this system include battery capacity monitoring, automatic charging, and charging termination control, aiming to ensure healthy charging of the battery and to enhance convenience and safety of use.
