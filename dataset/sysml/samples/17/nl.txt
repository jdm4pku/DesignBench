This system is used for vehicle fuel system management and is required to achieve efficient supply and return of fuel. The system consists of two core components: the Fuel Tank Assembly and the Engine. Fuel must flow from the fuel tank to the engine through the fuel supply port, while the engine can also return unused fuel back to the fuel tank. Each fuel interface should provide the current temperature information of the fuel to facilitate subsequent monitoring and regulation. The system should ensure efficient fuel flow and information tracking during both supply and return processes, meeting the requirements for reliability, safety, and monitoring of fuel delivery during normal vehicle operation.
