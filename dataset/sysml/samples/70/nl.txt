The system model of this project primarily outlines the basic requirements for a vehicle and its engine. The vehicle's total mass must not exceed 2000 kilograms when fully fueled, and should not be higher than 1500 kilograms when empty. The engine must be capable of effectively transmitting its generated torque to the transmission system through a clutch interface, and the torque generated by the engine should vary with speed, conforming to the relevant performance table specifications. The design of both the vehicle and its engine must meet these critical requirements for mass and power interface to ensure overall vehicle performance and safety.
