The system needs to be capable of managing and representing information related to automobiles, with a particular emphasis on parameters associated with vehicle torque values. The system should support the representation of Automobile objects and allow users to refer to automobiles using the alias "Car." It should also facilitate the handling and importing of basic physical quantities such as torque values (TorqueValue), and support the use of "Torque" as an alias for torque value. Furthermore, the system should be able to flexibly import and manage various scalar physical quantity data to meet the requirements of automobile-related data processing and modeling.
