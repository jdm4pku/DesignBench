The system must be capable of calculating the core parameters of vehicle dynamics, including the vehicle's power output, acceleration, speed, and position under various operating conditions. It should accurately calculate the vehicle’s actual available power output based on key input parameters such as wheel power, aerodynamic drag coefficient, friction coefficient, vehicle mass, and speed. Additionally, the system should be able to deduce the vehicle’s acceleration based on effective power, mass, and current speed, and utilize the obtained acceleration, initial speed, and time to calculate the vehicle’s speed at any given moment. Furthermore, the system should have the capability to estimate vehicle displacement based on speed and time, helping end-users comprehensively analyze and predict the dynamic performance of the vehicle under specific operating conditions. The overall requirements emphasize high accuracy, clear logical relationships between parameters, and results that are convenient for practical engineering applications.
