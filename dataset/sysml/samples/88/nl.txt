The vehicle safety compliance system requires that all components of the vehicle possess corresponding safety features, some of which are mandatory. The vehicle interior must be equipped with two seat belts, and both seat belts are required safety features. Additionally, the driverâ€™s airbag is an optional safety feature and is not mandatory. For the vehicle body, a bumper is required as a mandatory safety component, while the keyless entry system is a non-mandatory configuration. In the chassis system, the number of tires is fixed, and the anti-lock braking system (ABS) is an optional safety feature. Furthermore, the system categorizes and manages all safety-related parts and further distinguishes which safety components are required by law or industry standards and which are non-mandatory configurations, ensuring that the vehicle meets fundamental safety standards while offering more optional safety functions.
