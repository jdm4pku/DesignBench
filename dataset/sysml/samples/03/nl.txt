The system needs to define and describe a vehicle structure, in which each vehicle is composed of multiple components. A vehicle consists of major components such as one engine, one transmission, and four wheels. These components are all subclasses of vehicle components. The overall vehicle structure should reflect the compositional relationships and quantity requirements among the various componentsâ€”for example, a vehicle must be equipped with exactly four wheels, as well as one engine and one transmission. The system should also support extensibility for both vehicle and component types, in order to accommodate different vehicle configurations and component varieties, thereby better meeting the needs of automotive structure design and management.
