This system is designed to manage and monitor the maintenance schedule of vehicles. For each vehicle, a specific time for the next maintenance and a fixed maintenance interval will be set, and the maximum allowed temperature will be recorded. The system will automatically determine whether the vehicle has reached the maintenance time. Once the scheduled maintenance time is reached, the vehicle status will switch to "under maintenance." The system requires that the actual maintenance start time must be later than the scheduled maintenance time, and the maintenance must be initiated within 2 seconds after the previous healthy state ends. The duration of the maintenance must not exceed 48 hours. After the maintenance is completed, the vehicleâ€™s next maintenance time will be automatically postponed according to the maintenance interval, and its health status will be restored to normal.
