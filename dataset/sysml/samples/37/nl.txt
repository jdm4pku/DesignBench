This system is designed to manage the power status of a vehicle, enabling automatic switching between different operating states according to various control signals. When the user sends a vehicle start command, the system switches the vehicle from the off state to the start phase, and upon receiving the vehicle started signal, it enters the vehicle powered-on state. During the powered-on period, the system automatically performs self-diagnosis operations and continuously supplies power to various functional units of the vehicle. When the user issues a vehicle shutdown command, the system automatically executes safety operations such as parking brake engagement and returns the vehicle to the off state to cut off the power supply, ensuring safety. This entire process realizes intelligent control and state management of the vehicle's power supply, thereby enhancing the convenience and safety of vehicle use.
