The system must be capable of transmitting and outputting power, and logically should have the ability to provide power as well as generate torque. The system should include a torque generator component responsible for generating torque. At the physical level, the system must include a powertrain, which should contain an engine responsible for the actual execution of torque generation. The function of the systemâ€™s torque generator should be able to be mapped and implemented onto the engine within the powertrain, achieving effective correspondence and allocation between logical functions and physical implementation.
