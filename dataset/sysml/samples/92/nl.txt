The system must possess a clear capability for structural decomposition, namely, the ability to explicitly present a top-down hierarchical structure, dividing the system into multiple subsystems and components, and ensuring that the functions and capabilities of each level are fully covered. The interfaces between system components should be well defined, so that each component can be independently understood and analyzed while also collaborating effectively within the overall system. Furthermore, system engineers and parties involved in Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) must be able to use this structural view to comprehend and verify the systemâ€™s integrity and modular design, thereby ensuring that the system's various functional and performance requirements are met.
