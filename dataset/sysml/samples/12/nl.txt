This system is designed to implement a water supply network that delivers hot and cold water from a main supply pipe (SpigotBank) through corresponding interfaces (Spigot) to one or more faucets (Faucet). Each faucet is equipped with hot and cold water inlets (FaucetInlet). The system is required to reliably deliver hot and cold water from the respective outlets of the main supply pipe to the corresponding inlets of all downstream faucets, ensuring simultaneous supply to multiple water usage points. Additionally, the system must guarantee correct connection and smooth transmission of the hot and cold water pipelines, thereby meeting the basic requirements for distributed hot and cold water supply in various settings.
