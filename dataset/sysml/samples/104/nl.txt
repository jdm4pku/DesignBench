This system is designed to implement the functional architecture of an automotive powertrain, including the input of fuel commands, engine start-stop control, and support for power transmission and distribution. Users can control the system’s power output through fuel commands. Once the engine is ignited and started, the system generates engine torque according to the fuel command. The torque is then sequentially amplified from the engine to the transmission, transmitted to the driveshaft, and finally distributed to the left and right wheels, thus enabling control of the vehicle’s driving force. Additionally, users can shut down the engine via a command, triggering the cessation of the system’s powertrain. During engine shutdown, generation and transmission of driving force will likewise be suspended, ensuring safe and intelligent operation of the system.
