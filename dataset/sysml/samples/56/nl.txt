This system is used for the quality aggregation management of objects with mass attributes. Each object has a basic mass attribute (simpleMass) and a total mass attribute (totalMass). For the most basic object (simpleThing), its total mass is equal to its own basic mass. For a composite object (compositeThing), it can contain several subcomponents, each of which is an object with mass. Its total mass is the sum of its own basic mass and the total mass of all its subcomponents. The system can automatically calculate and aggregate the mass of components at all levels of the composite, achieving hierarchical management and statistics of mass.
