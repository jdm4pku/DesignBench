The system requirements are described as follows: This project aims to design and model a typical vehicle power transmission system, mainly including the engine, transmission (gearbox), clutch, driveshaft, rear axle assembly (including differential and left/right half-shafts), wheels, and the interface for interaction with the road surface. The engine receives control signals via a fuel command port and is coupled to the transmission through power and clutch ports. Power is transmitted via the driveshaft to the rear axle assembly. The rear axle assembly includes a differential that connects separately to the left and right half-shafts, delivering power to the rear wheels through interfaces between the shafts and wheels. Each rear wheel is equipped with interfaces to both the rear axle and the road, enabling power output to the ground. The interfaces between the internal components of the system are clearly defined, allowing for flexible combination and hierarchical decomposition at various levels and within major assemblies. This supports port and component binding, redefinition, and multi-level nesting, ensuring clear transmission of power and command flows among the components. The system is designed to be modular and reconfigurable, meeting the needs of vehicle dynamics modeling, simulation, and subsequent optimization design. It enables end users to understand, adjust, and expand the relationships and functions of various vehicle power components with ease.
