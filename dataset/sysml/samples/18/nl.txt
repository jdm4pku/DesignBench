The system should enable users to obtain photos from real-world scenes. Specifically, after a user selects a scene they wish to capture, the system should first automatically perform focusing for the selected scene and generate an intermediate image. Next, based on the focused image, the system should capture and output the final photo. Ultimately, users can directly obtain photos that meet their requirements from the selected scene, while the system completes the focusing and shooting processes automatically in the background, without requiring manual intervention at each step.
