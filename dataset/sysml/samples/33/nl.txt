The system is designed to implement a camera information processing workflow. When a user selects a scene through the cameraâ€™s viewfinder (viewPort), the system first focuses on the scene to obtain an image (Image). This image is then captured to generate a photograph (Picture). After the photograph is generated, the system displays it on the screen via the display port (displayPort). The user does not need to be concerned with specific technical details during operation and only needs to complete scene selection and shooting. The system will automatically handle the processes of focusing, capturing, and displaying the photograph.
