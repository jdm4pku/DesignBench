This system model describes the safety compliance requirements of a car. It requires that the interior must be equipped with two mandatory seat belts, and explicitly states that the driver’s airbag is not a mandatory requirement (optional). The bumper in the body section is set as a mandatory safety device, while the keyless entry system is not a required safety option. For the wheel assembly, the car is equipped with two wheels and includes an optional anti-lock braking system (ABS). The model specifically separates “safety-related components” and “mandatory safety components” into two packages: all components marked as safety-relevant (@Safety) are recorded in “Safety Features,” while only those that are both safety components and marked as mandatory (@Safety and isMandatory=true) appear in the category of “Mandatory Safety Features.” This clearly distinguishes which safety configurations are legally required for installation and which are optional. This model helps companies and users clearly understand the safety configuration requirements of vehicles, facilitating compliant design and procurement decisions.
