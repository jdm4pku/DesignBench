This system is designed to provide automatic braking control functions for vehicles. When the user turns the vehicle key to the start position, the system is automatically activated and continuously monitors the status of the brake pedal as well as traction information such as road adhesion. By detecting the brake pressure generated when the driver presses the brake pedal and evaluating traction variations under different road conditions, the system can intelligently adjust the brake pressure and modulation frequency during the braking process. This ensures that the vehicle achieves safe and reliable braking performance under various operating conditions, thereby enhancing driving safety and comfort. The entire process is automatically monitored and dynamically regulated without user intervention, ensuring that the braking system always operates in its optimal state.
