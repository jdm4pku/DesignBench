This system is designed to implement a typical automotive Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication and control model, encompassing key components such as the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) and the Engine Control Unit (ECU). Internal vehicle communication is carried out via the CAN bus, with the Vehicle Control Unit and Engine Control Unit each connected to the CAN bus through their respective Bus Interfaces (BusIF). This enables monitoring and control of both vehicle and engine states. Additionally, the system reserves interfaces for sensor data exchange to support future functional expansion. The entire model aims to reflect the physical connections and information flow among the main modules of modern automotive electronic control systems, ensuring reliable and efficient collaboration among vehicle subsystems, and meeting the comprehensive requirements for safety and performance at the vehicle level.
