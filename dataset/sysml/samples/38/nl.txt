The system shall be capable of managing the vehicle’s start-up, operation, and shutdown processes. When the user issues a vehicle start signal while the vehicle is in the shutdown state, the vehicle should enter the start-up state. Upon receiving a vehicle started signal, the system shall set the vehicle status to running. If the user issues a vehicle shutdown signal during operation, the vehicle status shall return to shutdown. The system must accurately respond to the corresponding signals, enabling automatic switching among the three main states—shutdown, start-up, and running—so that the user can conveniently and safely control the vehicle’s start and stop processes.
