This system is designed for modeling and managing risks and failures. It is capable of identifying and describing various possible situations, the causes leading to their occurrence, and the potential failures that may result. The system should be able to record the probability of each cause and the severity level of each failure. By establishing causal relationships, it analyzes the sequence and impact mechanisms among different situations. In addition, the system should support comprehensive modeling of different risk scenarios, enabling users to evaluate and manage potential risks and failures in an all-round manner. This provides a basis for risk control and decision-making.
