This system is designed to describe and constrain the composition and mass requirements of a vehicle. The vehicle consists of three main components: the chassis, the engine, and the transmission, each with its own mass attribute. The system requires that the total mass of all vehicle components must not exceed 2,500 kilograms. In addition, the dynamic behavior of the vehicle is considered: the system supports modeling the vehicle's dynamic constraints under known initial velocity, final velocity, mass, applied force, and over a given period of time, ensuring that the mass must be greater than zero, and that the physical relationship among force, time, and change in velocity is satisfied. Through these constraints, the system can be used during vehicle design to verify the rationality of total mass and dynamic performance.
