This system is designed to implement a power connection and disconnection mechanism between a vehicle and a trailer. The vehicle and the trailer each possess independent structural frames; a hitch ball is installed on the vehicle frame, while a trailer coupler is installed on the trailer frame. The system enables the vehicle and the trailer to be “connected” or “disconnected” via the hitching mechanism, and allows users to safely and reliably connect the trailer to the vehicle when needed, or disengage it. This achieves a flexible combination and separation, meeting user requirements for vehicle and trailer power coupling functions in various scenarios.
