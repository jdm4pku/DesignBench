This system is used to manage the start-up and shutdown states of a vehicle. The vehicle is initially in the off state. Upon receiving a "vehicle start signal," the vehicle switches to the "starting" state. Subsequently, when a "vehicle power-on signal" is received, the vehicle transitions to the "on" state. At any time, if a "vehicle shutdown signal" is received, the vehicle state switches back to the "off" state. The system must, according to the above logic, reliably ensure that the vehicle state responds appropriately to the corresponding control signals, and safely and sequentially transitions between each state.
