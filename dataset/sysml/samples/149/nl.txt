The system needs to implement a typical Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) message interaction model, supporting message producers to publish messages on specific topics to the server, while consumers can subscribe to topics of interest through the server. The system requires that when a producer publishes a new message, the server is able to promptly receive the published information and, according to the existing topic subscription relationships, distribute and deliver the message to the corresponding subscribers, ensuring that subscribers can accurately and promptly receive the message content of the topics they follow. Users only need to declare the topics they wish to subscribe to, without needing to know the specific publishers or other subscribers. The entire process must feature clear management and efficient processing of message subscription, publishing, and distribution flows.
