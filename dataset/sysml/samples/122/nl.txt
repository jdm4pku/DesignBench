This system is designed to ensure that vehicle fuel economy meets relevant regulatory and performance requirements. Under urban driving conditions, the vehicleâ€™s range per gallon must not be less than 25 miles; under highway conditions, it must not be less than 30 miles. Fuel economy is measured in "miles per gallon," based on the US customary gallon (231 cubic inches). Fuel economy tests are conducted with the vehicle assuming an additional load of 1,000 pounds, under standard urban and highway driving scenarios respectively. The measured fuel economy must meet the minimum requirements stated above. The system models and analyzes key parameters such as vehicle powertrain, load, and operating conditions, supporting fuel consumption assessment under various conditions to ensure that the designed vehicle can achieve the regulatory fuel economy targets for both urban and highway scenarios.
