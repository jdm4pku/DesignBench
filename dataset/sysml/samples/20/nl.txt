This system is designed to support photography workflows, allowing users to frame and capture a scene. First, the user selects a specific scene, and the system performs a focusing process on the selected scene to generate an image. Then, based on this image, the system carries out the shooting process to produce a final photograph. The overall workflow automatically completes the focusing and shooting steps, ensuring that users can conveniently convert the scenes they see into high-quality photographs without manually handling intermediate image processing and conversion tasks.
