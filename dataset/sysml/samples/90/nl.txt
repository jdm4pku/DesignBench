This system is designed for systematic risk metadata modeling and management across various scenarios, causes, and failures. Users can identify and describe different scenarios that may occur within the system. For each scenario, the specific causes and their probabilities of occurrence can be detailed, and possible failure types along with their severity levels can be associated. Furthermore, the system supports the description and tracking of causal relationships between scenarios, facilitating the understanding and analysis of risk propagation chains. On this basis, users can also combine a set of interrelated scenarios, causes, and failures to form complete risk scenarios, supporting risk analysis and decision-making. The system metadata is compatible with standard modeling languages, making it easy to integrate into larger systems engineering environments and enhancing the systematic capabilities of risk identification, analysis, and management.
