This system is designed to provide vehicles with efficient fuel delivery services. The system includes a storage tank as the initial fuel reservoir, from which fuel is extracted and delivered to vehicles via a fuel pump. Inside the vehicle, there is a fuel tank used to receive and store the delivered fuel, as well as to monitor both the maximum capacity and the current fuel level in real-time. The flow path of the fuel is clear and controllable: it is output from the storage tank, passes through the fuel pump, and ultimately enters the vehicle’s fuel tank, thus realizing end-to-end fuel management—from storage, to delivery, to usage. The system focuses on the transfer and quantity changes of fuel at each stage, ensuring that vehicles can obtain the required fuel in a timely, safe, and accurate manner to meet normal operation needs.
