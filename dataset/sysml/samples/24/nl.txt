This system is designed to support users in a workflow for capturing high-quality photographs. Users can select a scene, after which the system first performs focusing on the scene and generates an image that is then evaluated for focus quality. If the image is determined to be well-focused, the system proceeds with the shooting operation, converting the focused image into a photograph and ultimately producing the final photo required by the user. The entire shooting process is automatically linked from scene input to photo output, ensuring that shooting only takes place when the focus is appropriate, thereby improving the clarity and quality of the resulting photographs.
