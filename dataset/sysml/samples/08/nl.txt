The system needs to support vehicle modeling. Each vehicle should include quality attributes and be able to specify driver information, as well as be equipped with an independent fuel tank. The fuel tank must be able to store a specific type of fuel.

Overall, there should be clear associations between each element to ensure a comprehensive description of vehicles and their components.
