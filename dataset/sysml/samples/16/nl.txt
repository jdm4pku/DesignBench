This system is designed to provide fuel supply and return management functions for vehicles. The system consists of a fuel tank assembly and an engine unit. The fuel tank supplies fuel to the engine through a fuel outlet port that connects to the engine’s fuel inlet port, and can also receive fuel return from the engine. Port information includes attributes such as fuel temperature, ensuring that relevant parameters can be monitored in real time during both supply and return processes. The engine and fuel tank are connected via fuel interfaces, enabling both forward flow (supply) and reverse flow (return) of fuel to meet the engine’s normal operation requirements and ensure an efficient fuel circulation system. The design objective of this system is to ensure that the vehicle engine can continuously and reliably obtain the required fuel, while also supporting fuel return processing, thereby improving the intelligence and safety of the overall vehicle fuel management.
