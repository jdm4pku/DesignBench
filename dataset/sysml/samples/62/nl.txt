This system is designed to restrict and manage the vehicleâ€™s total mass, ensuring that the overall vehicle weight does not exceed the maximum permitted limit of 2,500 kilograms. The vehicle consists of a chassis, an engine, and a gearbox, each with its own mass parameter. The system will automatically calculate the total mass of the chassis, engine, and gearbox, and check whether this total complies with the requirement of not exceeding 2,500 kilograms. If the combined mass of the chassis, engine, and gearbox exceeds the specified limit, the system will issue an overweight warning, ensuring that the vehicle design meets the relevant weight regulations.
