This system is designed to provide a message interaction mechanism for vehicles equipped with cruise control functionality. Drivers can send set speed commands, which are first processed by the cruise controller upon receipt. The cruise controller then reads real-time speed information from the speed sensor (speedometer). Based on the difference between the set speed and the actual speed, the cruise controller calculates and generates a fuel control command. This fuel control command is first transmitted to the engine controller for processing, after which the engine controller forwards the command to the engine to ultimately control fuel flow and achieve speed adjustment and stabilization. Throughout the entire process, each system component communicates and collaborates via standardized message interfaces, thereby ensuring reliable, efficient, and safe operation of the cruise control function.
