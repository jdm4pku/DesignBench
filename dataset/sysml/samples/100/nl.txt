This system is designed for modeling configuration variants of vehicles. The core components include the complete vehicle, front and rear axles, and tires, with key attributes such as mass defined for each. The default vehicle mass is set to 1750 kg and consists of one front axle and one rear axle, each of which is equipped with two ordered tires. The system supports variant modeling; for example, in the vehicle configuration named "vehicle1_c1," the total vehicle mass can be further increased to 2000 kg, and the front axle can be replaced with a dedicated front axle featuring a steering angle. Meanwhile, specific instances of the front axle, rear axle, and tires can be renamed and managed to meet the requirements of various vehicle configurations. The model requires that the attributes of each component can be explicitly defined, inherited, and overridden, allowing users to flexibly configure various vehicle structures and to provide detailed descriptions and management of specific variants. This supports the needs of different configuration scenarios in actual vehicle design and assembly processes.
