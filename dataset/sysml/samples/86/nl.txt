The system shall be capable of performing automated simulation and analysis of vehicle dynamic behavior. Users should be able to input the vehicle’s initial velocity, initial position, acceleration at a specific moment, and the time step. Through integration with the ModelCenter analysis tool, the system shall automatically calculate and output the vehicle’s velocity and position after the specified time step based on the given physical model. The system must ensure accurate data transfer and reliable output of simulation results, enabling users to conveniently obtain key dynamic parameters to support vehicle performance analysis and design optimization.
