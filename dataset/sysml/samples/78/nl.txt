This system is designed to support comprehensive transportation scenarios, enabling a driver and up to four passengers to be safely transported from the starting point to the destination. Users first enter the vehicle, after which the driver operates the vehicle under the influence of environmental conditions, and may refuel at a gas station as needed to ensure a smooth journey. Upon arrival at the destination, the driver and passengers can safely exit the vehicle, thereby completing the entire transportation process. The system should ensure that interactions among all participants are simple and convenient, meeting the primary needs of daily transportation.
