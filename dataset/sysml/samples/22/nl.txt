In this system, users can complete the entire photography process—from composition to imaging to photo output—through a software package called "PhotographyWorkflow." When a user needs to take a photograph, the system first focuses (Focus) on the captured scene (Scene) to generate a frame of image (Image). The system then performs a shooting (Shoot) operation on the focused image to ultimately produce a photograph (Picture). Users only need to input the desired scene to be photographed; the system will automatically complete the focusing and imaging operations and directly output the required photograph, thereby realizing an automated and streamlined photography workflow.
