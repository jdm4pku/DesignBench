The system needs to implement an information classification management mechanism based on the “traffic light” principle. Information is divided into three levels: “Unclassified,” “Confidential,” and “Secret,” each corresponding to a code and a color: unclassified information uses the code “uncl” and is marked in green; confidential information uses the code “conf” and is marked in yellow; and secret information uses the code “secr” and is marked in red. In addition, the system must also support grade classification. Grade levels include A, B, C, D, and F, which correspond to 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.0 points, respectively. The classification of different types of information and the scores for grades must be clearly defined and distinguished in the system, so that users can easily and intuitively identify various categories of information and grades during operation and management.
