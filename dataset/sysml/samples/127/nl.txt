This system is designed to realize the torque generation function within the powertrain system. The system should include relevant components capable of generating torque, and it is required that the torque produced during operation must be greater than zero newton-meters to ensure driving capability. During the design and implementation process, the logic layer's torque generator function should be effectively allocated and mapped to the physical layer of the powertrain (including actual components such as the engine), thereby ensuring the actual generation and transmission of torque to meet the overall vehicle power output requirements.
