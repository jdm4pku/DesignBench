This system is designed to simulate and analyze the longitudinal (straight-line) dynamic characteristics of vehicle motion. Users can input vehicle mass parameters, initial position, initial velocity, and a set of segmented power output data. Based on the input power and operating conditions, the system will successively calculate the vehicleâ€™s acceleration, velocity, and position at each moment using dynamic equations with a specified time step. It will then output the sequences of acceleration, velocity variation, and displacement throughout the vehicle's entire motion process. This provides data support and a decision-making basis for applications such as vehicle performance analysis, control strategy development, and driving behavior evaluation.
