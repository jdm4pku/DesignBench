This system is designed to implement a camera function capable of taking photos of various scenes. The system includes automatic focusing on objects within the scene and the imaging process. When the user selects a scene, the camera first obtains a clear and realistic image through the autofocus subsystem. Afterwards, the imaging subsystem captures this image as a photograph. All photos taken are recorded and saved by the system. Users do not need to concern themselves with the internal technical details; they only need to select or confirm the scene to be photographed, and the camera will automatically complete the focusing and imaging operations to generate high-quality photos for the user.
