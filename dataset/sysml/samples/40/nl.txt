This system is designed to enable intelligent monitoring and management of vehicle health status. During normal operation, the system automatically senses the current vehicle temperature and compares it with the preset maximum allowable temperature. If the vehicle temperature exceeds the maximum allowable value, the system promptly sends an over-temperature warning to the vehicle controller and switches the vehicle health status to "degraded" mode; when the temperature returns to a safe range, the status automatically reverts to normal. In addition, the vehicle undergoes periodic maintenance at scheduled intervals. When the specified maintenance time is reached, the system automatically enters maintenance status, and after maintenance is completed, the next maintenance cycle time is updated. After the maintenance status has lasted for 48 hours, the vehicle automatically returns to normal operating status. This system operates automatically, helping users to detect and address vehicle over-temperature and maintenance needs in a timely manner, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of vehicle operation and reducing manual intervention.
