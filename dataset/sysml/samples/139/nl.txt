This system is used for modeling the structural and functional constraints of automotive components, where a car comprises several wheels and related parts. The vehicle has a total mass of 1200 kilograms and a length of 4.82 meters, and is equipped with multiple wheel assemblies. Each wheel assembly consists of a set of tires and the corresponding brake disc. A single wheel is composed of a rim and a tire, with the rim diameter being 18 inches, tire width 245 millimeters, and tire height 45 millimeters, based on which the outer diameter is calculated. The default tread depth of the tire is 6.0 millimeters, and it must not be less than 3.5 millimeters to comply with road safety regulations. The brake disc assembly installed on each wheel assembly has a radius of 95 millimeters, and the system requires that the brake disc diameter (i.e., twice the radius) of each wheel assembly must be less than the outer diameter of the corresponding wheel, ensuring proper installation and safety clearance between components. The system also enforces related constraints to ensure that all wheel assemblies meet the fitment requirements between the brake disc and rim, thereby safeguarding overall safety and performance.
