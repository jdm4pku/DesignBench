The system needs to support a structured description of tire information. Each tire entry should include the manufacturer name, rim diameter, tire width, as well as optional installation position information (i.e., a coordinate vector in three-dimensional space). The rim diameter should be expressed in inches, which is the commonly used unit in the United States. The system should be able to distinguish between tires from different manufacturers and with different specifications, for example, a French Michelin brand tire with an 18-inch rim diameter and a width of 245, and be able to record all the aforementioned attributes completely. At the same time, the system should possess data scalability to accommodate future additions of other brands, sizes, and installation information.
