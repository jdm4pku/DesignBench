The system requires that the total mass of the vehicle (including curb weight and fuel mass) must not exceed the specified maximum mass limit, and the fuel mass must be a positive value. In addition, the engine must be able to generate corresponding torque according to the speed curve, and the torque produced by the engine must be effectively transmitted to the transmission through the clutch interface to ensure that power is smoothly delivered to the vehicleâ€™s drive system.
