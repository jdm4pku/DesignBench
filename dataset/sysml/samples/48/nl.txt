This system aims to implement an automotive cruise control function that enables the driver to set a target speed through the cruise control interface. The vehicle can automatically detect the current speed and, based on the set target speed, automatically adjust the engine output to maintain steady vehicle speed. When the driver sends a set speed command via the cruise control interface, the instruction is transmitted to the vehicle's cruise controller. The vehicle obtains real-time actual speed information via a speed sensor, and the detected speed information is fed back to the cruise controller. The cruise controller compares the set speed with the actual speed and automatically generates corresponding engine fuel control commands, which are sent to the engine to adjust the vehicle's power so that the driving speed remains as close as possible to the target speed set by the driver. Each component of the system exchanges information such as set speed, speed sensing, and fuel control efficiently and accurately via data ports, ensuring simple driver operation and reliable system operation, and effectively fulfilling the requirements for automatic cruise control.
