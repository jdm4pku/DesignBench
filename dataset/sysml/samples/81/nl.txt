The system is designed to describe an automotive configuration space, supporting combinations of different engines and transmission systems. Vehicles can be equipped with either a 4-cylinder or 6-cylinder engine, with each engine type containing the corresponding number of cylinders. Cylinder diameter is a key parameter and can be selected between two specifications: 70mm and 100mm. Each vehicle can only be fitted with one type of engine and one type of transmission system. The transmission can be either a manual or an automatic gearbox. Furthermore, the following constraints apply to concrete configurations: if the engine is a 4-cylinder, a manual transmission must be used; if the engine is a 6-cylinder, an automatic transmission must be used. This model provides users with a clear structure and constraints, enabling the flexible selection of vehicle components and parameters according to actual requirements.
