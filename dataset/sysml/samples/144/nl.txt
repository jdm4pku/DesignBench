The system needs to be able to manage spare parts, personnel, and various related collection types. For spare parts, it should support archiving and management in the form of Bags, with each element in a Bag being a spare part. For integers, the system should support storage in the form of Lists, where each list item is an integer value. For strings, the system should be able to manage strings as Sets. For personnel, the system should support management using OrderedSets, with each element being of the Person type. Additionally, the system should support nested collection management, such as storing a List composed of multiple personnel sets (Set<Person>). For real numbers (Real), the system should allow processing in the form of fixed-length arrays (with a length of 4). All these collection data structures should support integration and interaction with other business functions to facilitate flexible retrieval and use of related information.
