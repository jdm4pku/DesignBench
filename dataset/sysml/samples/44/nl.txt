This system is a cruise control system, mainly composed of the driver, cruise controller, speedometer, engine, and vehicle, among other components. The driver activates the cruise function by sending a command to set the desired speed. The cruise controller inside the vehicle receives this set-speed command and subsequently obtains the actual vehicle speed information from the speedometer. Based on these inputs, the cruise controller generates and sends corresponding fuel control commands to the engine. The speedometer collects the real-time speed of the vehicle and transmits this information to the cruise controller, while the engine adjusts its output according to the received fuel control commands to ensure the vehicle travels at the set speed. The aforementioned modules exchange information through events to realize the cruise control function as expected by the driver.
