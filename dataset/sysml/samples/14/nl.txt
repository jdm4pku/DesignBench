This system is used for the automotive fuel system and covers the requirements for components such as the fuel tank assembly, fuel pump, and fuel tank. The fuel tank assembly provides an outlet interface for fuel (including a return function), enabling the delivery of fuel to the engine or other components, as well as the reception of returned fuel. The fuel pump, installed inside the fuel tank assembly, serves to pump fuel from the fuel tank and supply it to the engine, while also being capable of receiving returned fuel. The system is able to monitor and transmit fuel temperature information. It is required that fuel can circulate efficiently and safely among all components, meeting the vehicle's overall requirements for fuel supply and return functions, and ensuring normal fuel supply to the engine.
