This system is designed to manage and control the start-up, operation, health monitoring, and related automatic control logic of a vehicle (VehicleA). The vehicle should support multiple operating states, including Off, Starting, Running, and Health Management states. During the start-up process, the vehicle can only transition from the Off state to the Starting state when the brake pedal is pressed and a start signal is received; subsequently, it enters the Running state upon receiving a vehicle-on signal. Once switched to the Running state, the system will automatically perform self-checks, supply power to the vehicle, and automatically apply the parking brake when exiting this state. The system also features self-perception of health, being capable of real-time detection and output of the vehicle’s temperature; when the temperature exceeds a safety threshold, the system will switch the vehicle to a degraded mode and send an over-temperature signal to the controller. The system also supports Maintenance and Degraded states, and can return to the Normal state upon receipt of a restore-to-normal signal. Meanwhile, the vehicle controller has its own operation state management and can switch the vehicle’s main control states in response to start-up and shut-down signals. The design of this system emphasizes automated response, health monitoring, and safety control to ensure that the vehicle operates in a safe, controllable, and maintainable state.
