This system is designed to provide complete fuel supply and return management functions for vehicles. The vehicle is equipped with a fuel system composed of a fuel tank assembly, which integrates both the fuel pump and the fuel tank. The fuel pump is responsible for pressurizing fuel from the tank and delivering it to various fuel-consuming units within the vehicle, while allowing unused fuel to return to the tank via the return line. The system must monitor and transmit real-time fuel temperature information to ensure the safety and efficiency of fuel transport. The overall fuel flow path and interface definitions are clearly specified, and both data and fuel flow between components are strictly bound according to the design, thereby achieving reliable fuel supply and effective return management.
