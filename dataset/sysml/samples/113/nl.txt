This system is designed to enable automated modeling of vehicle behavior, primarily comprising two core components: the vehicle and the vehicle controller. The vehicle is capable of autonomously managing its operation and health status under different conditions. Normally, the vehicle only initiates the startup process from the shutdown state when both the brake pedal is pressed and a start signal is received; after meeting these requirements, it completes self-inspection and power supply procedures. The system can sense temperature in real time, and when overheating is detected, it automatically sends a warning signal to the vehicle controller, switches the vehicle status to degraded mode, and ensures safety. Health management also includes regular maintenance and fault recovery mechanisms to ensure timely maintenance and restoration from abnormal states to normal. The vehicle controller receives and processes various control and status signals from the vehicle, enabling automatic control operations such as starting and shutting down. The overall system supports configuration of attributes such as fuel, maintenance intervals, and temperature thresholds, thereby achieving intelligent, safe, and efficient management of vehicle operation processes.
