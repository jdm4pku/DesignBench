This system is designed to automate the photography process. Users only need to provide a shooting scene, and the system will first perform focus processing on the scene to generate an image suitable for shooting. It will then convert the image into a photograph through a shooting operation. The entire process is seamlessly integrated, requiring no in-depth user intervention in focusing or shooting details. This simplifies the photography workflow, helping users obtain the final photograph easily and efficiently.
