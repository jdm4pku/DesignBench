This system is designed to describe the fuel system of motor vehicles, including the fuel supply and return process between the fuel tank assembly and the engine. As the fuel supply port, the fuel tank is capable of providing fuel to the engine, while the engine can also return a portion of the fuel to the fuel tank, ensuring the circulation and utilization of fuel. During the fuel flow process, the system can monitor key parameters such as temperature to ensure the safety and efficiency of fuel supply. The entire fuel system is designed to support interface connections between different components, ensuring smooth and well-integrated fuel supply routes, and meeting the requirements for stability and reliability of fuel supply during vehicle operation.
