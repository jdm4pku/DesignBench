This system aims to model the coupling system between a vehicle and a trailer. The system consists of one vehicle and one trailer, which are connected via a coupling mechanism (such as a tow hitch or ball connector). The vehicle itself does not directly possess a coupling ball but instead connects by referencing the ball within the hitch component. This means that the vehicle can physically connect to any compatible hitch without the need for a dedicated built-in component. Similarly, the trailer is bound to the connector in the hitch component by reference, allowing for their physical interfacing. This design ensures the reusability and flexible combination of each component, facilitating quick adaptation and assembly of various vehicle and trailer models. Furthermore, when disconnecting or removing components, individual parts can be independently detached without affecting the normal operation of other components. This enhances the modularity of the coupling system and simplifies maintenance.
