This system is designed to implement basic camera shooting and display functionality. While framing, the user can input the current scene into the system. The system first performs a focusing process on the scene to obtain an image; then, it captures the obtained image to generate a photo. Finally, the system automatically displays the captured photo on the screen, allowing the user to view the shooting result immediately. The entire process ensures that scene processing, image generation, and photo display are seamlessly and automatically integrated. The user only needs to perform a simple shooting operation to obtain a complete experience of photographing and viewing the result.
