This system is designed to ensure that the combined weight of the main vehicle components (including the chassis, engine, and transmission) does not exceed 2,500 kilograms. The system must be able to accurately record and manage the weight of each component, with the weight data for the chassis, engine, and transmission all required as inputs. The system should automatically sum the weights of these components, and when the total weight exceeds the specified limit, it must provide a warning or impose restrictions to ensure that the designed vehicleâ€™s total weight complies with relevant regulatory requirements, thereby ensuring product legality, compliance, and safety.
