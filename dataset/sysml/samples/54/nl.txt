This system is designed to perform hierarchical modeling and aggregation of the quality (mass) information of vehicles and their components, facilitating automatic calculation and management of the total vehicle mass. In the system, each object with a quantifiable mass can either be a simple component or a composite object assembled from other components. Every component contains its own mass information and can automatically aggregate the total mass of itself and all its subcomponents. For example, the total mass of a complete vehicle includes the body itself as well as all parts such as the engine, transmission, and other components. Core components such as the engine and transmission are explicitly defined and assigned under the whole vehicle, and their data can be individually specified. Through this model, users can quickly acquire the total mass of a specific vehicle, while the numbering and weight information of any component can be clearly recorded, achieving transparency, automated statistics, and traceability of vehicle mass.
