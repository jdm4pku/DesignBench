This system is designed to implement the control logic of an automotive powertrain. Its main functions are as follows: Upon receiving a fuel control command, the system sequentially starts the engine and generates torque according to the predetermined order. The generated torque is then successively amplified, transmitted, and distributed, delivering power stage by stage to the vehicleâ€™s drive wheels to ensure normal driving. When a stall signal is detected, the relevant operational processes will be halted as required. The system supports engine start and shutdown control, as well as the entire power transmission process from fuel commands to actual wheel output torque, ensuring efficient and coordinated power delivery. It provides users with a reliable power response and handling experience.
