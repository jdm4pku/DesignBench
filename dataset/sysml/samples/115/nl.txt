This system is designed to provide multiple configuration management solutions for automotive products. The automobile, as the main system, can select different subsystem configurations according to various needs and conditions. The system mainly includes two configurable components: Subsystem A and Subsystem B. Subsystem A offers two configuration options: one consisting of Component 1 and Component 2, and the other consisting of Component 2 and Component 3. Similarly, Subsystem B also has two configuration options: one consisting of Component 4 and Component 5, and the other consisting of Component 5 and Component 6. When configuring a vehicle, users can choose different implementations of the above subsystems as needed, but must comply with the following constraint: if the second configuration of Subsystem A is selected, then Subsystem B must select the third configuration, or Subsystem A must not be the second configuration. In addition, the system comes with two predefined vehicle configurations, namely Configuration A and Configuration B. Configuration A adopts the first implementation of Subsystem A (Component 1 and Component 2) together with the third implementation of Subsystem B (Component 4 and Component 5). Configuration B adopts the second implementation of Subsystem A (Component 2 and Component 3) combined with the third implementation of Subsystem B (Component 4 and Component 5). This system model supports flexible product customization, meeting different user needs while ensuring the rationality and consistency among configurations.
