The system needs to establish a specification model for automotive components, capable of describing relevant attribute information for car tires. Each tire should include parameters such as the manufacturer name, rim diameter, and width. The rim diameter should be represented as a real number indicating the length, the manufacturer should be identified by a string, and the width should be an integer value. Additionally, the system should be able to instantiate and distinguish tires of different brands and specifications. For example, it should be able to generate a tire data instance with the manufacturer as Michelin, a rim diameter of 18.0, and a width of 245 as a French tire. This will provide clear and structured fundamental data support for the selection, configuration, and management of vehicle components.
