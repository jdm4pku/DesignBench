This system is designed to implement a complete photography workflow. The user only needs to trigger the "take photo" operation once, and the system will automatically complete all subsequent steps. First, the system acquires the current shooting scene and inputs it into the focus function, automatically performing the focusing process to generate an image. Then, based on the obtained image, the system executes the shooting operation to produce the final photograph. After the shooting is finished, the system immediately displays the resulting photo, enabling the user to intuitively view the shooting result. The entire process is seamlessly integrated by the system, without requiring manual intervention from the user at each step, greatly improving the convenience and smoothness of photography.
