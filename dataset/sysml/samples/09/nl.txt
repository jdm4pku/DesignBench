This system is designed to describe the structure of an automobile wheel assembly. The system includes components such as the wheel bearing unit, tire, bead, hub, rim, bolt mounting hole, hub, threaded hole, and bolt connection. The tire is sealed and fastened by pressing its two beads onto the two rims of the hub. Multiple mounting holes are provided on the hub, which are connected to the threaded holes on the hub using bolts, thereby ensuring a reliable connection between the hub and the tire assembly. This model provides a detailed description of the specific relationships and connection methods between each component, thus offering structural-level support for the design, assembly, and maintenance of the wheel assembly and further helping to ensure the structural strength and safety of the wheel.
