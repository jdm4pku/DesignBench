This system is designed to implement the cruise control function for vehicles. The driver can send a set speed command to the cruise controller through operation. After receiving the set speed, the cruise controller acquires the real-time vehicle speed information from the speedometer. Subsequently, the cruise controller generates a corresponding throttle control command based on the difference between the actual vehicle speed and the set speed, and sends this command to the engine system to adjust the vehicle's power output, thereby achieving automatic control of the vehicle speed. The entire process realizes the automatic response to the driver's intent, improving driving comfort and safety.
