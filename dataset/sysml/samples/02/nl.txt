This system is designed to model various types of vehicles. Vehicles are mainly divided into two categories: manually operated vehicles and powered vehicles. Manually operated vehicles are driven by personnel, with each vehicle corresponding to a single driver; powered vehicles are equipped with engines as their source of power. In addition, certain vehicles are both manually operated and equipped with engines, and are classified as manually operated powered vehicles. The system also includes two entities, Personnel and Engine, which are used to describe drivers and power devices of vehicles, respectively. Through this model, the relationships among personnel, vehicles, and their power devices in various vehicle types can be fully represented.
