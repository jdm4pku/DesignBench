This system is designed to manage the connection status between a vehicle and a trailer. The system includes one vehicle and one trailer. The vehicle is equipped with a chassis and a tow ball, while the trailer features a coupler and a trailer frame. The system enables the vehicle to connect to or disconnect from the trailer by means of the tow ball on the vehicle’s chassis and the coupler on the trailer’s frame, thus facilitating the hitching and unhitching operations between the trailer and the vehicle. Users can conveniently connect or disconnect the trailer via the system, ensuring that the trailer can be safely and reliably coupled to the vehicle when needed, and can be smoothly detached when not required, thereby enhancing the convenience and safety of vehicle-trailer combinations.
