This system is used to verify and validate the parameters of the car headlamp tilt adjustment knob, ensuring that the adjusted beam tilt angle falls within a reasonable range. Specifically, the tilt angle of the headlamp beam (measured in degrees) must be between 50 degrees and 80 degrees; any value outside this range does not comply with safety and regulatory standards. The system adopts the International System of Units (SI) and standard real number constants (such as pi and Eulerâ€™s number e) to ensure precision and consistency in calculations, thereby achieving scientific and reliable management of the headlamp beam adjustment knob functionality.
