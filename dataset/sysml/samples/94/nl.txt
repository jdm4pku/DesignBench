This system model aims to provide standardized definitions and annotations for fundamental concepts and elements in the automotive domain. In the model, “汽车” (automobile) is designated as a core component, with the alias “汽车 (Car)” defined to facilitate communication and usage in various application scenarios. The model also includes comprehensive explanatory comments to help developers and users better understand the meaning and application context of each element. Additionally, the model associates relevant physical quantities such as “扭矩 (Torque)” to ensure standardized and consistent expression of automotive characteristics. The overall design emphasizes clarity and extensibility, enabling convenient development, integration, and maintenance of subsequent automotive-related systems.
