This system is designed to implement the shooting process of a digital camera, enabling users to complete the entire procedure from viewfinding and focusing to imaging with a single, simple operation. Users only need to select the shooting scene; the camera will then automatically focus on the selected scene and generate an image that meets the requirements, after which the imaging module will capture and produce the final photo. The entire shooting process is fully automated without the need for users to manually adjust the focus or initiate imaging. All functional modules collaborate to complete the entire process of shooting and image acquisition, ensuring an efficient and convenient shooting experience and outputting high-quality photos.
