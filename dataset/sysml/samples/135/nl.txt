The system is required to provide a set of standard and precise constants for scientific computing and simulation applications, including mathematical constants, fundamental physical constants, and context-specific parameters. Specifically, the system should have built-in commonly used mathematical constants such as Euler’s number e and pi π, with numerical precision up to 20 decimal places. At the same time, it should integrate typical physical constants, including the precisely defined speed of light in vacuum, the fine-structure constant, and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, with clear SI unit annotations. Additionally, the system should support scenario-based constants, such as standard gravitational acceleration on Earth and the amplifier gain coefficient in specific products (e.g., Model X). All constants should be easily accessible and verifiable by the system, in order to meet the high standards of scientific computation and engineering domains.
