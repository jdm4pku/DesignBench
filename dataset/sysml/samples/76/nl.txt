The system is designed to verify the mass of vehicles to ensure that the actual mass of each vehicle does not exceed 2,500 kilograms. Under this system, every vehicle to be inspected must undergo a mass inspection process to check whether its mass complies with the specified upper limit. The system consists of vehicles, weighing equipment, and a mass verification unit. It measures the current actual mass of the vehicle using the weighing equipment and processes and evaluates the measured data. If the inspected vehicle's mass is less than or equal to 2,500 kilograms, it is deemed qualified; if it exceeds this value, it is deemed unqualified. The entire mass verification process is carried out independently for each vehicle to ensure that all vehicles involved in verification comply with the relevant standards and regulatory requirements.
