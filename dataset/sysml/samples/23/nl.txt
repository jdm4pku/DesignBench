This system is designed to support the photography workflow, allowing users to select a scene and capture it as a photograph. In the shooting process, the selected scene is first focused to ensure optimal image sharpness. If the camera detects that the focus is clear, it will proceed to take the photo, generating the final image. The entire process automatically performs focusing and shooting operations in sequence, providing users with a convenient one-click shooting experience while ensuring the clarity and quality of the photos.
