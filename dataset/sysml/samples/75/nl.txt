To ensure that the quality of vehicles meets relevant requirements, the system needs to check the curb weight of each vehicle. The curb weight of each vehicle must be less than or equal to 2,500 kilograms. The relevant tests include collecting the actual weight data of the vehicle, processing the collected data, and using the processed data as the basis to determine whether the vehicle's weight meets the specified standards, ultimately producing a qualified or unqualified evaluation result. This process must have clear steps of data collection, processing, and evaluation to ensure the scientific and accurate detection of vehicle quality.
