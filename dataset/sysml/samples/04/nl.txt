The system must be able to define and distinguish between different types of vehicles, including small vehicles and large vehicles, with each category equipped with a specific type of engine. All vehicles are equipped with an engine component: small vehicles must be equipped with a small engine, which contains 4 cylinders, while large vehicles must be equipped with a large engine, which contains 6 cylinders. Each engine contains a functional subsystem composed of a specific number of cylinders to meet the actual requirements of the vehicle's power system. By strictly classifying vehicle types and the specifications of their key components, the system ensures the adaptability and reliability of each type of vehicle in terms of structure and performance.
