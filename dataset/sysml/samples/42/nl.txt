This system is used to control the vehicle’s start-stop process. The vehicle is initially in the off state. Upon receiving a "start signal," it enters the start process. During startup, the system will only respond to the "power-on signal" after detecting that the brake pedal has been depressed, and will simultaneously send a start signal to the controller. Once the vehicle enters the operating state, it will automatically perform a self-check and continuously supply power to the vehicle. When a "stop signal" is received, the process returns the vehicle to the off state. Upon leaving the operating state, the parking brake will be automatically applied to ensure parking safety. The overall system is designed to ensure the safety and reliability of the vehicle’s start-stop process, as well as coordinated control with the controller.
