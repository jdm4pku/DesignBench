This system is used for the aggregation and management of the mass of objects with mass attributes. Each object has a basic mass and can also contain several subcomponents. The system can automatically calculate the total mass, including all subcomponents. For supported composite objects, the total mass equals the sum of the object's own basic mass and the full mass of all its subcomponents. In addition, the system supports mass-based filtering and aggregation of components; that is, a minimum mass threshold can be set so that only subcomponents whose mass is not less than this threshold are counted. In this case, the total mass is the sum of the object's own mass and the mass of all subcomponents that meet the specified minimum mass requirement. This system is suitable for hierarchical decomposition and overall mass control of complex products or equipment structures, enabling users to flexibly aggregate mass information from different dimensions according to actual needs.
