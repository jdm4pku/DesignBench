This system is designed to describe the basic structure and operating principles of a vehicle fuel system. The vehicle is equipped with a fuel tank assembly and an engine, which are connected through fuel lines to facilitate fuel supply and return. The fuel tank assembly is responsible for supplying fuel to the engine, and after combustion and usage, the engine returns the unused portion of the fuel back to the fuel tank. Throughout the entire fuel flow process, the system can monitor and transmit information on the fuel temperature to ensure operational safety and system efficiency. This fuel system design ensures that the vehicle receives a continuous and stable fuel supply during operation, effectively recycles excess fuel, and optimizes resource utilization.
