The system needs to be capable of managing multiple sensors and support monitoring and updating the status of these sensors. When the system detects that any sensor is in a ready state, it should automatically perform an update operation on that sensor. The system should be able to automatically traverse all registered sensors and promptly process and maintain each sensor that meets the ready condition, thereby ensuring that all available sensors are kept up-to-date. This will enhance the overall responsiveness and reliability of the system.
