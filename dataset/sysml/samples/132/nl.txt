The system is required to classify and label each component to meet information security management requirements. Every component must be clearly assigned a security classification level, such as "Unclassified," "Confidential," or "Secret." When a component is marked as "Confidential," the system should be able to recognize and display its corresponding classification attribute, thereby enabling effective differentiation and protection of sensitive information during system operation and document management.
