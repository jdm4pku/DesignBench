This system is designed to implement an automotive cruise control function. The driver sends a set speed command to the system via the in-vehicle control interface. After receiving this command, the cruise controller compares the set speed with the current vehicle speed information provided by the speed sensor (speedometer). Upon obtaining the current vehicle speed, the cruise controller calculates the difference between the set speed and the actual speed, generates the corresponding throttle control command, and sends it to the engine. This adjusts the engine output to maintain or reach the set speed. Throughout this process, the driver, cruise controller, speedometer, and engine work together through message transmission. As a result, after the driver sets the target speed, the vehicle can automatically maintain that speed without the driver needing to continuously operate the accelerator pedal.
