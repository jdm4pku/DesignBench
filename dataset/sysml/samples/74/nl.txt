This system is designed to conduct a comprehensive selection analysis for various types of engines, including four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines. For each type of engine, the system will aggregate and calculate key performance indicators such as power, mass, efficiency, and cost. Based on these indicators, a unified evaluation function will be used to comprehensively assess each engine. Finally, according to the comprehensive evaluation results, the system will automatically screen and recommend the optimal engine selection from all candidates, thereby maximizing both engine performance and economic efficiency.
