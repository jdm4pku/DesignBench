This system adopts a layered architecture, including the application layer, service layer, and data layer. The application layer needs to use the functionalities provided by the service layer, while the service layer relies on the data layer to retrieve and store data. The system should possess three core attributes: x, y, and z, where attribute z depends on attributes x and y. The entire system must ensure clear division of responsibilities and dependencies between layers, guaranteeing smooth data flow and functional calls.
