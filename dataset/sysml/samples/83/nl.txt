This system is designed to achieve efficient allocation and management of the powertrain system. The powertrain system consists of a logical layer and a physical layer. In the logical layer, logical components are required to provide power and generate torque, among which the torque generator is responsible for converting power into torque. In the physical layer, there must be corresponding physical components to integrate these functionsâ€”for example, the power unit should be capable of both power output and torque generation. The system needs to ensure that the torque generator in the logical layer can be effectively mapped to the corresponding power unit (such as an engine) in the physical layer. Through this mapping relationship, all functional requirements can be accurately realized in the physical hardware, thus ensuring that the vehicle or equipment possesses power transmission and torque output capabilities, and meets the user's core demands for power performance.
