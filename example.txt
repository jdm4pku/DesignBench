I want the flashlight to turn on instantly when I grip it and press the power button, emitting a focused, steady beam that precisely lights up the area I need to see in front of me; when I press the same button again, the beam should shut off quickly to avoid unnecessary light pollution in the dark. I also expect the beam to be effectively reflected or diffused by nearby surfaces, widening the illuminated area so I can clearly see my surroundings while walking outdoors at night or inspecting tight spaces.
