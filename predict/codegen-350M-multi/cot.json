    "\nThe system is designed to identify and analyze potential risks and failure scenarios that may occur in the equipment. The equipment includes key components such as batteries, and it is required to continuously monitor the battery level during operation. When the probability of battery failure increases due to aging or other factors, the system must be able to detect such situations and identify the risk that “battery aging” may lead to “low battery level.” When the battery level falls below the set minimum threshold, the system should determine that the equipment is in a “low battery” state and further analyze the situation. If this state persists for a prolonged period without recovery, the device may automatically shut down, resulting in the failure consequence of “device shutdown.” For high-level failures that may cause the interruption of critical device functions, the system should assign an appropriate severity level in order to alert users and maintenance personnel, allowing timely intervene to mitigate potential risks and thus ensure the reliable operation of the equipment and the normal usage needs of the user.\n\nReferences:\n- SysMLv2.1, SysMLv2.2, SysMLv2.3, SysMLv2.4, SysMLv2.5",
