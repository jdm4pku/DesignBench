    "1. Extract key functional/non-functional information:\n\n    - The key functional information includes the definition of vehicles, engines, and the configuration of engine cylinders.\n    - The non-functional information includes the constraints such as the number of cylinders in an engine for different vehicle types.\n\n2. Map them to various grammar in SysML v2 textual grammar:\n\n    - The SysML v2 textual grammar is a standardized notation for describing systems and their components.\n    - The key functional information can be mapped to the SysML v2 textual grammar as follows:\n        - Vehicles can be modeled as instances of a Vehicle class.\n        - Engines can be modeled as instances of an Engine class.\n        - Cylinders can be modeled as instances of a Cylinder class.\n    - The non-functional information can be modeled as constraints on the classes. For example, an Engine class can have a multiplicity constraint that specifies that an engine must contain between 4 and 6 cylinders.\n\n3. Output only valid SysML v2 textual code:",
    "This problem is a textual modeling task that involves creating a textual representation of a system model in the SysML v2.1 standard. The SysML v2.1 standard is a modeling language for systems engineering, which includes elements such as requirements, activities, and artifacts.\n\n    Here is a Python solution using the `pyuml2` library to generate the SysML v2.1 textual model:\n\n    ```python\n    from pyuml2 import *\n\n    # Create a package\n    package = Package(\"FuelSystem\")\n\n    # Create a class for the fuel tank\n    fuel_tank = Class(\"FuelTank\")\n    package.add_element(fuel_tank)\n\n    # Create a class for the fuel interface\n    fuel_interface = Interface(\"FuelInterface\")\n    package.add_element(fuel_interface)\n\n    # Create a class for the engine\n    engine = Class(\"Engine\")\n    package.add_element(engine)\n\n    # Create a class for the fuel flow\n    fuel_flow = Class(\"FuelFlow\")\n    package.",
