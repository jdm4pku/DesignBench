    "\nA SysML v2 textual grammar model that describes the vehicle structural architecture described in the input requirement.\n\n1. The vehicle is a core component of the system model.\n2. The vehicle has an attribute for mass, which is defined as the total vehicle mass.\n3. The vehicle contains two front axle assemblies, each comprising specific axle components and two sequentially arranged wheels.\n4. The front axle can optionally be configured with a special type that features a steering angle parameter.\n5. The left and right wheels on both the front and rear axles can be distinctly identified and named, thus supporting the individual recognition and control of each wheel.\n6. The entire model is designed to provide a clear and flexible hierarchical combination of components and attribute descriptions for vehicle structural design and configuration, facilitating the needs of vehicle design, assembly, and subsequent maintenance management.\n\nSysML v2 Textual Grammar Model:\n\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<petri net>\n<pet"
