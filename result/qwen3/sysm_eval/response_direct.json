For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. **Class `VehicleAStateMachine`**\n- **Generated model:** No explicit class named `VehicleAStateMachine`, but the state machine is modeled as states for `VehicleA` and its controller. **COVERED** (semantically, as the state machine is present).\n\n#### 2. **State `Off` (with initial)**\n- **Generated model:** `state off;` with `transition initial then off;` in `operational states`. **COVERED**\n\n#### 3. **State `Starting` (with entry action `startEngine()`)**\n- **Generated model:** `state starting;` with transition from `off` to `starting` on `'Vehicle Start Signal'` and `brake pedal depressed`, and `do send 'Start Signal'()`. No explicit `entry / startEngine()`, but the transition action is equivalent. **COVERED**\n\n#### 4. **State `Running` (entry: `performSelfChecks()`, `supplyPower()`, exit: `applyParkingBrake()`)**\n- **Generated model:** `state on` with `entry 'perform self test'; do 'provide power'; exit 'apply parking brake';` **COVERED**\n\n#### 5. **Substate `Normal` (initial, during `monitorTemperature()`, transition to `Degraded` on `temperature > safetyThreshold` with `sendOverTemperatureSignal()`)**\n- **Generated model:** `state normal;` in `health states`, with transition to `degraded` on `'sense temperature'.temp > Tmax` and `do send 'Over Temp'()`. No explicit `during / monitorTemperature()`, but the temperature is sensed in the state. **COVERED**\n\n#### 6. **Substate `Degraded` (entry: `switchToDegradedMode()`, exit: `sendRestoreToNormalSignal()`)**\n- **Generated model:** `state degraded;` but no explicit entry/exit actions. **NOT COVERED** (actions missing)\n\n#### 7. **Substate `Maintenance` (entry: `enterMaintenanceMode()`)**\n- **Generated model:** `state maintenance;` but no explicit entry action. **NOT COVERED** (action missing)\n\n#### 8. **State `Degraded` (entry: `switchToDegradedMode()`, exit: `sendRestoreToNormalSignal()`)**\n- **Generated model:** `state degraded;` (same as above), no entry/exit actions. **NOT COVERED**\n\n#### 9. **State `Maintenance` (entry: `enterMaintenanceMode()`)**\n- **Generated model:** `state maintenance;` (same as above), no entry action. **NOT COVERED**\n\n#### 10. **Transition: `Off` -> `Starting` when `(brakePressed and startSignal)`, do `startEngine()`**\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'off-starting'` from `off` to `starting`, accepts `'Vehicle Start Signal'` and `if vehicle1_c1.'brake pedal depressed'`, does `send 'Start Signal'()`. **COVERED**\n\n#### 11. **Transition: `Starting` -> `Running` when `vehicleOnSignal`, do `engineStarts()`**\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'starting-on'` from `starting` to `on`, accepts `'Vehicle On Signal'`. No explicit action, but the state change is present. **PARTIALLY COVERED** (action missing, but transition present). Let's be strict: **NOT COVERED**\n\n#### 12. **Transition: `Running.Normal` -> `Running.Degraded` when `temperature > safetyThreshold`, do `sendOverTemperatureSignal()`**\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'normal-degraded'` from `normal` to `degraded`, accepts when `'sense temperature'.temp > Tmax`, does `send 'Over Temp'()`. **COVERED**\n\n#### 13. **Transition: `Running.Degraded` -> `Running.Normal` when `restoreToNormalSignal`, do `restoreNormalOperation()`**\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'degraded-normal'` from `degraded` to `normal`, accepts `'Return to Normal'`. No explicit action. **NOT COVERED**\n\n#### 14. **Transition: `Running.Normal` -> `Running.Maintenance` when `maintenanceRequired`, do `enterMaintenanceMode()`**\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'normal-maintenance'` from `normal` to `maintenance`, accepts at `maintenanceTime`. No explicit action. **NOT COVERED**\n\n#### 15. **Transition: `Running.Maintenance` -> `Running.Normal` when `maintenanceCompleted`, do `exitMaintenanceMode()`**\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'maintenance-normal'` from `maintenance` to `normal`, accepts `'Return to Normal'`. No explicit action. **NOT COVERED**\n\n#### 16. **Transition: `Running` -> `Degraded` when `temperature > safetyThreshold`, do `sendOverTemperatureSignal()`**\n- **Generated model:** This is similar to the `normal` to `degraded` transition above, but the model does not have a direct `on` (running) to `degraded` transition. **NOT COVERED**\n\n#### 17. **Transition: `Degraded` -> `Running.Normal` when `restoreToNormalSignal`, do `restoreNormalOperation()`**\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'degraded-normal'` from `degraded` to `normal`, accepts `'Return to Normal'`. No explicit action. **NOT COVERED**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- 1. Class VehicleAStateMachine: **COVERED**\n- 2. State Off: **COVERED**\n- 3.

Definition of enumeration `DrivingScenario` with literals `Urban` and `Highway`.\n- **Covered?** **Partially.** The generated model does not define an explicit enumeration, but it does define `cityScenario` and `highwayScenario` as calculations, which correspond to the two scenarios. **Accept as covered** due to semantic equivalence.\n\n#### 4. Definition of block `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model defines `part def Vehicle`.\n\n#### 5. `Vehicle` has a property `powertrain` of type `Powertrain`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model defines `part engine : Engine;` and `part transmission : Transmission;` inside `Vehicle`, which together represent the powertrain.\n\n#### 6. `Vehicle` has a property `load` of type `Mass`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model defines `attribute cargoWeight : MassValue;` in `Vehicle`.\n\n#### 7. `Vehicle` has a property `fuelEconomy` of type `FuelEconomy`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model defines `fuelEconomy_city` and `fuelEconomy_highway` as attributes of `Vehicle`, which together cover the concept.\n\n#### 8.

Definition of block `FuelEconomyTest`.\n- **Covered?** **Partially.** The generated model does not define a block named `FuelEconomyTest`, but the analysis context and requirements structure (e.g., `FuelEconomyAnalysis`, `FuelEconomyRequirement`, and the use of scenarios and test loads) serve the same purpose. **Accept as covered** due to semantic equivalence.\n\n#### 10. `FuelEconomyTest` has a property `drivingScenario` of type `DrivingScenario`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model's `FuelEconomyAnalysis` takes `scenario : NominalScenario` as input, which is instantiated as `cityScenario` or `highwayScenario`.\n\n#### 11. `FuelEconomyTest` has a property `testLoad` of type `Mass`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model uses `vehicle.cargoWeight` as the test load in requirements and analysis.\n\n#### 12. `FuelEconomyTest` has a property `result` of type `FuelEconomy`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model's `FuelEconomyAnalysis` returns `calculatedFuelEconomy`, which is mapped to `fuelEconomy_city` or `fuelEconomy_highway`.\n\n#### 13. Constraint: In context `FuelEconomyTest`, if `drivingScenario` is `Urban`, then `result >= 25.0@milesPerGallon`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model's `cityFuelEconomyRequirement` sets `requiredFuelEconomy = 25 [mi/gallon]`, and the requirement is that `actualFuelEconomy >= requiredFuelEconomy`.\n\n#### 14. Constraint: In context `FuelEconomyTest`, if `drivingScenario` is `Highway`, then `result >= 30.0@milesPerGallon`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model's `highwayFuelEconomyRequirement` sets `requiredFuelEconomy = 30 [mi/gallon]`, and the requirement is that `actualFuelEconomy >= requiredFuelEconomy`.\n\n#### 15. Constraint: In context `FuelEconomyTest`, `testLoad = 1000.0@pounds`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes.** The generated model's requirements for both city and highway fuel economy include `assume constraint { vehicle.cargoWeight == 1000 [lb] }`.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

(**covered**)\n- 11. SeatBelt sets isMandatory = true. (**covered**)\n- 12. Definition of block Bumper extends SafetyComponent. (**covered**)\n- 13. Bumper sets isMandatory = true. (**covered**)\n- 15. OptionalSafetyComponent sets isMandatory = false. (**covered**)\n- 16. Definition of block Airbag extends OptionalSafetyComponent. (**covered**)\n- 17. Definition of block AntiLockBrakingSystem extends OptionalSafetyComponent. (**covered**)\n- 18. Definition of abstract block SecurityComponent. (**covered**)\n- 19. Definition of block Alarm extends SecurityComponent. (**covered**)\n- 20. Definition of block KeylessEntrySystem extends SecurityComponent. (**covered**)\n\nThat's **12** claims fully covered.\n\nIf we are generous and count \"partially covered\" as covered (since the parts exist, but the structure is not identical), then we could add:\n\n- 3. VehicleSafetySecuritySystem has part mandatorySafety of type SafetyComponent[1]. (**partially covered**)\n- 4. VehicleSafetySecuritySystem has part optionalSafety of type OptionalSafetyComponent[0..1]. (**partially covered**)\n- 5. VehicleSafetySecuritySystem has part security of type SecurityComponent[1]. (**partially covered**)\n- 14. Definition of abstract block OptionalSafetyComponent extends SafetyComponent. (**partially covered**)\n- 24. VisualizeFunction has method displayAsTree(components: Set<Component>) returns (String). (**partially covered**)\n- 25. VisualizeFunction has method displayAsTable(components: Set<Component>) returns (String). (**partially covered**)\n- 27-32. The 6 relationships mapping parts to types. (**partially covered**)\n\nThat's 7 more (3+1+2+6=12), so 12+12=24.\n\nBut per the instructions, only \"the same or equivalent element\" counts as covered, so \"partially covered\" is not enough unless the semantics are equivalent. In this case, the generated model does not have the same structure (no \"mandatorySafety\" part, etc.), so we should not count those as covered.\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nScore: 12/32**"

The property `temperature` is present, but the unit is not specified.\n\n- If we count functional equivalence (as per instructions to ignore naming/formatting), then claims 12 and 14 are covered. For claims 13 and 15, the lack of unit specification is a minor omission, but the property is present.\n\n**Final coverage:**\n\n1. Covered\n2. Covered\n3. Covered\n4. Covered\n5. Covered\n6.

'AddCharge' could correspond to 'startCharging' or 'supplyCharge'. **Supported** (semantics match).\n8. **Action 'EndCharging'**: The reference model has 'stopCharging' and 'terminateCharge'. **Supported**\n9a. **Composite action 'ChargeBattery'**: The reference model has 'automaticChargingControl' and 'monitorBatteryLevel' behaviors that together implement charging logic. **Supported**\n9b. **'start' step**: The reference model does not specify a 'start' step, but behaviors are initiated. **Supported** (as a generic start).\n9c. **'merge continueCharging' step**: The reference model has a loop in 'automaticChargingControl', which is similar to 'continueCharging'. **Supported**\n9d. **Action 'monitor' of type 'MonitorBattery' with output 'batteryCharge'**: The reference model's 'monitorBatteryLevel' checks 'battery.currentLevel'. The output is not explicit, but the monitoring is present. **Supported**\n9e. **Decision: if 'monitor.batteryCharge < 100' then 'addCharge'**: The reference model's 'monitorBatteryLevel' checks if 'battery.currentLevel < battery.maxLevel' then calls 'charger.startCharging()'. The threshold is 'battery.maxLevel' instead of 100, but the logic is equivalent. **Supported**\n9f. **Decision: if 'monitor.batteryCharge >= 100' then 'endCharging'**: The reference model's 'monitorBatteryLevel' checks if 'battery.currentLevel >= battery.maxLevel' then calls 'charger.stopCharging()'. Again, threshold is 'battery.maxLevel' instead of 100, but logic is equivalent. **Supported**\n9g. **Action 'addCharge' of type 'AddCharge' with input 'charge = monitor.batteryCharge'**: The reference model's 'startCharging' and 'supplyCharge' do not explicitly take a charge value, but the action of charging is present. **Supported**\n9h. **'continueCharging' step**: The reference model's 'automaticChargingControl' loops, which is equivalent. **Supported**\n9i. **Action 'endCharging' of type 'EndCharging'**: The reference model's 'stopCharging' and 'terminateCharge' are equivalent. **Supported**\n9j. **'done' step**: The reference model's behaviors terminate, but 'done' is not explicit. **Supported** (as a generic end).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count:\n\n- **Total atomic claims:** 1 (package) + 1 (import) + 1 (attribute) + 1 (battery part) + 1 (powerSystem part) + 1 (MonitorBattery action) + 1 (AddCharge action) + 1 (EndCharging action) + 10 (ChargeBattery steps: 9a-9j) = **17**\n- **Supported claims:** All except 2 (import), 3 (BatteryCharged attribute), and 5 (powerSystem part) are supported.

For this evaluation, since the name is different but the semantics are similar, we can consider it **supported**.\n\n5. **'UpdateSensors' has an input parameter 'sensors' of type 'Sensor[*]'.**  \n   - **Supported.** The reference model's monitorSensorsBehavior takes a 'system' parameter, and the system has a 'sensors' part of type 'Sensor[*]'. The generated model passes the sensors directly, which is a structural simplification but semantically equivalent.\n\n6. **'UpdateSensors' is specified in the language \"Alf\".**  \n   - **Supported.** The reference model's behaviors are also specified in an action language (implied by the use of 'ownedAction' and the code-like structure).\n\n7. **The body of 'UpdateSensors' (in Alf) contains a loop over 'sensors', checking 'sensor.ready', and calls 'Update(sensor)' if true.**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model's behavior loops over sensors, checks if 'sensor.status == SensorStatus.Ready', and calls 'updateSensor(sensor)'. The generated model checks 'sensor.ready' (Boolean) and calls 'Update(sensor)'. The logic is similar, but the attribute and method names differ.

Import of ScalarValues::Real (use of Real type)\n2. Import of ISQ::* (use of ISQ types, e.g., PowerValue, MassValue, SpeedValue, etc.)\n\n**Calculation Definitions:**\n3. Definition of calculation Power with inputs: whlpwr (PowerValue), Cd (Real), Cf (Real), tm (MassValue), v (SpeedValue)\n4. In Power: attribute drag = Cd * v\n5. In Power: attribute friction = Cf * tm * v\n6. In Power: return : PowerValue = whlpwr - drag - friction\n\n7.

Definition of calculation Position with inputs: dt (TimeValue), x0 (LengthValue), v (SpeedValue)\n12. In Position: return : LengthValue = x0 + v * dt\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.**\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n1. **Import of ScalarValues::Real (use of Real type)**  \n   - Supported: The reference model uses Real as a base type.\n\n2. **Import of ISQ::* (use of ISQ types, e.g., PowerValue, MassValue, SpeedValue, etc.)**  \n   - Partially Supported: The reference model defines types like Power, Mass, Speed, etc., as Real, but does not use ISQ or the \"Value\" suffix. However, the semantics are equivalent (types for power, mass, speed, etc.), so we will count this as supported.\n\n3. **Definition of calculation Power with inputs: whlpwr (PowerValue), Cd (Real), Cf (Real), tm (MassValue), v (SpeedValue)**  \n   - Supported: The reference model defines a constraint for effective power using wheelPower, dragCoefficient, frictionCoefficient, mass, speed, etc.\n\n4. **In Power: attribute drag = Cd * v**  \n   - Not Supported: In the reference model, drag is calculated as F_drag = 0.5 * dragCoefficient * airDensity * frontalArea * speed^2. The generated model omits airDensity, frontalArea, and the 0.5 factor, and uses a linear (not quadratic) dependence on speed. This is not equivalent.\n\n5. **In Power: attribute friction = Cf * tm * v**  \n   - Not Supported: In the reference model, F_friction = frictionCoefficient * mass * gravity, and P_friction = F_friction * speed. The generated model omits gravity and directly multiplies friction coefficient, mass, and speed. This is not equivalent.\n\n6. **In Power: return : PowerValue = whlpwr - drag - friction**  \n   - Partially Supported: The structure matches the reference model's effectivePower = wheelPower - P_drag - P_friction, but since the definitions of drag and friction are not equivalent, this is only partially supported. For scoring, we will count it as not supported, since the calculation is not correct.\n\n7. **Definition of calculation Acceleration with inputs: tp (PowerValue), tm (MassValue), v (SpeedValue)**  \n   - Supported: The reference model defines acceleration = effectivePower / (mass * speed) - (F_drag + F_friction) / mass. The generated model only includes the first term, omitting the second. So, this is only partially supported. For atomic claims, the definition of the calculation is supported, but the formula is not fully supported.\n\n8. **In Acceleration: return : AccelerationValue = tp / (tm * v)**  \n   - Not Supported: As above, this omits the (F_drag + F_friction) / mass term present in the reference model.\n\n9. **Definition of calculation Velocity with inputs: dt (TimeValue), v0 (SpeedValue), a (AccelerationValue)**  \n   - Supported: The reference model has speed = initialSpeed + acceleration * time.\n\n10. **In Velocity: return : SpeedValue = v0 + a * dt**  \n    - Supported: Matches the reference model's speed = initialSpeed + acceleration * time.\n\n11. **Definition of calculation Position with inputs: dt (TimeValue), x0 (LengthValue), v (SpeedValue)**  \n    - Partially Supported: The reference model has position = initialPosition + initialSpeed * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time^2. The generated model omits the acceleration term and uses only x0 + v * dt.\n\n12. **In Position: return : LengthValue = x0 + v * dt**  \n    - Not Supported: As above, this omits the acceleration term.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- 1.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1. There is a package named MassVerificationSystem.\n- **Generated model:** The package is named 'VehicleMassVerificationTestSystem', not 'MassVerificationSystem'.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered** (name is different, and the package is not just a renaming but a different context).\n\n#### 2. There is a value type MassValue based on Real, with unit kg.\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit value type named MassValue. However, attributes use `ISQ::mass`, which likely represents a mass quantity with units (kg).\n- **Coverage:** **Partially covered** (the concept of mass with units is present, but not the named value type MassValue).\n\n#### 3. There is a block Vehicle.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part definition `Vehicle`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**\n\n#### 4. Vehicle has a property actualMass of type MassValue.\n- **Generated model:** Vehicle has an attribute `mass :> ISQ::mass`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (naming difference, but same semantics)\n\n#### 5. There is a block WeighingEquipment.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part definition `Scale`, which may correspond to WeighingEquipment, but the name is different and the mapping is not explicit.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered** (no explicit WeighingEquipment or clear mapping)\n\n#### 6. There is a block MassVerificationUnit.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit block or part definition named MassVerificationUnit.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered**\n\n#### 7. MassVerificationUnit has a property upperMassLimit of type MassValue, default value 2500.\n- **Generated model:** The requirement `vehicleMassRequirement` constrains `massActual <= 2500[SI::kg]`, which is equivalent to an upper mass limit of 2500 kg, but there is no explicit property.\n- **Coverage:** **Partially covered** (the constraint is present, but not as a property)\n\n#### 8. MassVerificationUnit has a property weighingEquipment of type WeighingEquipment.\n- **Generated model:** No such property or explicit structure.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered**\n\n#### 9. MassVerificationUnit has a constraint: actualMass <= upperMassLimit.\n- **Generated model:** The requirement `vehicleMassRequirement` expresses `massActual <= 2500[SI::kg]`, which is equivalent.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (semantics are present)\n\n#### 10. There is a block MassVerificationSystem.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part definition `MassVerificationSystem`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**\n\n#### 11. MassVerificationSystem has a property vehicle of type Vehicle.\n- **Generated model:** The part `massVerificationSystem` contains a part `vehicleTestConfig : Vehicle`, which is used as the test subject. This is a similar structure.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (semantics are present)\n\n#### 12. MassVerificationSystem has a property massVerificationUnit of type MassVerificationUnit.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit property or part of type MassVerificationUnit.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Inputs: **Covered** (the generated action has inputs for initial velocity, position, acceleration, and time step, though with different names and types)\n   - 10e-10f. Outputs: **Covered** (the generated action has outputs for final velocity and position)\n   - 10g. Action with equations: **Covered** (the action is named differently, but the intent is the same; equations are implied by the action)\n11-12. Constraints: **Not present**\n\n### B. PhysicalModel\n13.

Let's clarify:\n\n- The generated model has a single action `computeDynamics` with inputs and outputs corresponding to both the system and physical model behaviors.\n- The equations are implied by the action.\n- The ModelCenter integration is represented by metadata, not as a block/operation.\n\nSo, the following claims are covered:\n\n- Inputs/outputs for dynamics (initialVelocity, initialPosition, acceleration, timeStep, finalVelocity, finalPosition): **Covered** (for both behaviors)\n- Action for dynamics: **Covered**\n- Equations: **Covered**\n- ModelCenter integration: **Partially covered** (metadata present, but not as a block/operation)\n\nLet's count only unique claims covered:\n\n- Inputs: initialVelocity, initialPosition, acceleration, timeStep (4)\n- Outputs: finalVelocity, finalPosition (2)\n- Action for dynamics (1)\n- Equations (2)\n- ModelCenter integration metadata (1)\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10**\n\nBut since the reference model has these claims in both the system and physical model, and the generated model only has one action, we should count coverage for both behaviors.\n\nSo, for both behaviors (simulateVehicleDynamics and computeDynamics):\n\n- Inputs: 4 x 2 = 8\n- Outputs: 2 x 2 = 4\n- Action: 2\n- Equations: 2 x 2 = 4\n\nTotal: 8 + 4 + 2 + 4 = **18**\n\nPlus, ModelCenter integration metadata: 1\n\n**Total covered claims: 19**\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 19/29**"
