A part definition 'Person' exists.\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.**\n\n1. **Package 'VehicleDefinition' is defined.**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model uses 'VehicleSystem', but package naming differences are to be ignored only if the structure matches. Here, the package is just a container, so this is not a meaningful modeling element for precision.\n2. **Private import of ScalarValues::* is present.**  \n   - **Not supported.** No such import in the reference model.\n3. **Part definition 'Vehicle' exists.**  \n   - **Supported.** The reference model has a part 'vehicle'.\n4. **'Vehicle' has an attribute 'mass' of type Real.**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model has 'mass', but its type is 'VehicleMass', not 'Real'. However, if we ignore type naming differences and focus on the presence of the attribute, this can be considered supported.\n5. **'Vehicle' has an attribute 'status' of type VehicleStatus.**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model does not have a 'status' attribute; instead, it has 'gearSetting' and 'acceleratorPosition' as separate attributes.\n6. **'Vehicle' has a part 'eng' of type Engine.**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model has an 'engineComponent' part with an 'engine' attribute, and an 'enginePort' for the vehicle. There is no direct 'eng' part, but the concept of an engine is present. However, the structure is not the same (the reference model uses ports and components, not a direct part). This is **not directly supported**.\n7. **'Vehicle' has a reference part 'driver' of type Person.**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model has a 'driverComponent' part with a 'driver' attribute and a 'driverPort' for the vehicle. There is no direct 'driver' part in 'vehicle'. This is **not directly supported**.\n8. **Attribute definition 'VehicleStatus' exists.**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model does not define a 'VehicleStatus' type; it defines 'GearSetting' and 'AcceleratorPosition' separately.\n9. **'VehicleStatus' has an attribute 'gearSetting' of type Integer.**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model has 'GearSetting' as an attribute of 'vehicle', not as part of a 'VehicleStatus' type. The attribute exists, but the structure does not match. **Not supported**.\n10. **'VehicleStatus' has an attribute 'acceleratorPosition' of type Real.**  \n    - **Partially supported.** Same as above; the attribute exists in the reference model, but not as part of a 'VehicleStatus' type. **Not supported**.\n11. **Part definition 'Engine' exists.**  \n    - **Supported.** The reference model defines 'Engine' as an attribute type and as a port type.\n12. **Part definition 'Person' exists.**  \n    - **Not supported.** The reference model defines 'Driver' as an attribute type and as a port type, but not 'Person'.

The reference's 'startEngine' takes fuelCmd and engineControlCmd and outputs torque, then 'generateTorque' takes torqueInput and outputs torqueOutput.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### A. Attribute/type definitions\n\n1. FuelCmd — **Covered** (attribute def FuelCmd)\n2. EngineStartSignal — **Partially covered** (attribute def EngineStart in generated model; likely equivalent)\n3. EngineStopSignal — **Partially covered** (attribute def EngineOff in generated model; likely equivalent)\n4. EngineOutputTorque — **Partially covered** (Torque is used as a general type; engineTorque is used as a variable)\n5. AmplifiedTorque — **Partially covered** (Torque is used as a general type; transmissionTorque is used as a variable)\n6. WheelTorque — **Partially covered** (Torque is used as a general type; wheelTorque1/wheelTorque2 are used)\n\n**Judgment:** The generated model uses a single Torque type for all torque-related attributes, and uses different variable names. For recall, if the structure is preserved, we count as covered.\n\n#### B. Port definitions\n\n7. FuelCmdPort — **Not covered** (no explicit port definitions)\n8. EngineStartPort — **Not covered**\n9. EngineStopPort — **Not covered**\n10. EngineOutputPort — **Not covered**\n11. TransmissionInputPort — **Not covered**\n12.

Port usage in parts\n\n19-28. All port usages in parts — **Not covered** (no explicit port usage in generated model)\n\n#### E. Perform statements (behavior allocation)\n\n29-34. All perform statements — **Partially covered** (the generated model allocates behavior to actions, but not to parts; so not covered in the same way)\n\n#### F. Interface/connection definitions\n\n35-39. All interface/connection definitions — **Partially covered** (the generated model uses flows between actions, but not explicit interfaces or connections between parts/ports)\n\n#### G. Action definitions\n\n40. sendFuelCmd — **Not covered** (no explicit sendFuelCmd action)\n41. sendEngineStart — **Not covered**\n42. sendEngineStop — **Not covered**\n43. generateEngineTorque — **Covered** (action 'Generate Torque')\n44. amplifyTorque — **Covered** (action 'Amplify Torque')\n45. distributeTorque — **Covered** (action 'Distribute Torque')\n46. receiveWheelTorque — **Not covered** (no explicit receiveWheelTorque action)\n\n#### H.

No explicit assignment from a port.  \n   - **Not covered.**\n\n9. **Definition of interface/connection `logicToPhysical` connecting `logicLayer.torqueCmdPort` to `physicalLayer.torqueCmdPort`, referencing `torqueGenerationRegion.torqueCmdFlow` from `source.torqueCmd` to `target.torqueCmd`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** No explicit port-to-port connection, but there is an allocation from logical to physical elements and actions.  \n   - **Partially covered (allocation is present, but not at port level).**\n\n10. **Definition of part `physicalLayer` inside `context`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** `PowerTrain` in `PhysicalModel` is the closest equivalent.  \n    - **Partially covered (semantically, as a physical element).**\n\n11. **`physicalLayer` has a port `torqueCmdPort` of type `TorqueCmdPort` (with `~`).**  \n    - **Generated model:** No explicit port.  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n12. **`physicalLayer` performs `torqueGenerationRegion.produceTorque` with input assignment: `torqueCmd = torqueCmdPort.torqueCmd` and output assignment: `torque = engine.torqueOutputPort.torque`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** `powerTrain.engine` performs `generateTorque`. No explicit input assignment from a port.  \n    - **Partially covered (action performed, but not the port assignments).**\n\n13. **Definition of part `engine` inside `physicalLayer`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** `engine` is a part inside `powerTrain`.  \n    - **Covered.**\n\n14. **`engine` has a port `torqueOutputPort` of type `TorqueOutputPort`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** No explicit port.  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n15. **Definition of action region `torqueGenerationRegion`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** No explicit action region, but actions are defined.  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n16. **In `torqueGenerationRegion`, definition of action `generateTorqueCmd` with output `torqueCmd` of type `TorqueCmd`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** `GenerateTorque` action with output `torque`.  \n    - **Partially covered (action with output, but not the same name or type).**\n\n17. **In `torqueGenerationRegion`, definition of succession/flow `torqueCmdFlow` from `generateTorqueCmd.torqueCmd` to `produceTorque.torqueCmd`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** No explicit succession/flow.  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n18. **In `torqueGenerationRegion`, definition of action `produceTorque` with input `torqueCmd: TorqueCmd` and output `torque: Torque`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** `GenerateTorque` action with output `torque`; `providePower.generateTorque` is performed by `engine`.  \n    - **Partially covered (action with output, but not explicit input).**\n\n19. **In `torqueGenerationRegion`, postcondition: `torque > 0`.**  \n    - **Generated model:** Requirement `torqueGeneration` with constraint `generator.generateTorque.torque > 0.0 [N*m]`.  \n    - **Covered.**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The reference model defines parts (user, meter, emergencyResponseSystem), ports, and actions, but not in the FMEA structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**None** of the atomic claims in the generated model are supported by the reference model. The generated model is a generic FMEA framework and an FMEA instance for a glucose meter, while the reference model is a system model for a blood glucose meter, with no FMEA structure.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n**Score: 0/98**",

TreadDepthDefault = 6.0 mm\n5. RimDiameter = 18 in\n6. TireWidth = 245 mm\n7. TireHeight = 45 mm\n8. BrakeDiscRadius = 95 mm\n11. car.mass : CarMass\n12. car.length : CarLength\n13. wheelAssemblies[*] (inside car)\n14. wheel (inside wheelAssemblies)\n15. rim (inside wheel)\n16. rim.diameter : RimDiameter\n17. tire (inside wheel)\n18. tire.width : TireWidth\n19. tire.height : TireHeight\n20. tire.treadDepth : TreadDepthDefault\n22. brakeDisc (inside wheelAssemblies)\n23. brakeDisc.radius : BrakeDiscRadius\n25. brakeDiscFitment constraint\n26. treadDepthConstraint constraint\n\n**Total fully covered: 21**\n\n#### Claims that are **partially covered**:\n10. car (inside context) (Vehicle_1/2 represent car, but not inside \"context\")\n21. wheel.outerDiameter = rim.diameter * 25.4 + 2 * tire.height (formula is present, but missing *25.4)\n24. brakeDisc.diameter = 2 * radius (2 * radius is used in constraints, but not as a property)\n\n**Total partially covered: 3**\n\n#### Claims that are **not covered**:\n9. context (no explicit context part)\n\n**Total not covered: 1**\n\n---\n\n#### How to count partial coverage?\n\nFor recall, we typically count only fully covered claims. If you wish to be generous, you could count partials as covered, but the instructions say \"contains the same or equivalent element\", so partials that capture the intent (e.g., 2 * radius used in constraints instead of as a property) can be considered covered.\n\n- Claim 10: \"car (inside context)\" — the car is present, but not inside a \"context\" part. Since the context part is not present, but the car is, this is arguably covered.\n- Claim 21: \"wheel.outerDiameter = rim.diameter * 25.4 + 2 * tire.height\" — the formula is present, but missing the *25.4 conversion. This is a semantic difference, so this is **not fully covered**.\n- Claim 24: \"brakeDisc.diameter = 2 * radius\" — 2 * radius is used in constraints, but not as a property. Since the value is used, this can be considered covered.\n\nSo, let's count claims 10 and 24 as covered, but not 21.\n\n**Final count:**\n- Covered: 22 (all except 9 and 21)\n- Total: 26\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score**\n\n**Score: 22/26**"

None of these match the reference model's attributes (VehicleStartCmd, VehicleStartedSignal, VehicleShutdownCmd, etc.).\n- The generated model defines a part: Vehicle. The reference model does not have a part named Vehicle; it has context, user, vehiclePowerSystem, engine, safetySystem, functionalUnits.\n- The generated model defines an action: performSelfTest (in vehicle: Vehicle). This does not match any action in the reference model.\n- The generated model defines a state machine: VehicleStates, with states off, starting, on, and transitions triggered by VehicleStartSignal, VehicleOnSignal, VehicleOffSignal. The reference model does not define a state machine or these states.\n- The generated model defines actions within the on state: providePower, applyParkingBrake. The reference model has actions with similar names (parkingBrakeEngagement, receivePower), but the structure and context are different, and the types and flows are not present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNone of the atomic claims in the reference model are covered by the generated model. The generated model is structurally and semantically different, with no matching elements (attributes, ports, parts, actions, or flows).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 0/52**"

For partial coverage (where the mapping is plausible and the semantics are preserved), we will count as covered, since the instruction says to ignore naming differences if the structure and semantics match.\n\n**Claims not covered:**\n- 1. Package name 'VehicleSystem' (not critical, but not matched)\n- 6. Part 'context' (not present as a named part, but its contents are present)\n- 16. Action 'vehicleOperation' (not explicit, but the sequence is present)\n- 17. 'vehicleOperation' contains action 'initialState' (not explicit, but present as a snapshot)\n- 23. 'vehicleOperation' contains action 'subsequentState' (not explicit, but present as a snapshot)\n\nHowever, for 6, 16, 17, and 23, the structure and semantics are preserved, even if the names are not. The instruction says to ignore naming differences if the structure and semantics match. The only claim that is not covered is the explicit presence of a 'context' part and the package name.\n\nThus, only claim 1 (package name) and claim 6 (explicit 'context' part) are not covered.\n\n**Total claims:** 27  \n**Covered claims:** 25\n\n**Score: 25/27**"

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model\n\n#### **A.

Calculations (calc def)**\n3. **Defines calculation Power with inputs**  \n   - **Partially supported**: The reference model computes forces and net power, but does not define a single \"Power\" calculation with these exact inputs. The calculation is distributed across several actions.\n4. **Power: drag = Cd * v**  \n   - **Supported**: The reference model uses dragCoefficient and speed to compute dragForce.\n5. **Power: friction = Cf * tm * v**  \n   - **Supported**: The reference model uses rollingResistanceCoefficient, vehicleMass, and speed to compute rollingResistanceForce.\n6. **Power: return PowerValue = whlpwr - drag - friction**  \n   - **Supported**: The reference model computes netForce (from wheelPower, dragForce, rollingResistanceForce), which is analogous.\n7. **Defines calculation Acceleration with inputs**  \n   - **Supported**: The reference model has an action calculateAcceleration with inputs netForce and vehicleMass; here, it's totalPower, mass, and speed, which is a different formula, but the intent is similar.\n8. **Acceleration: return AccelerationValue = tp / (tm * v)**  \n   - **Not supported**: The reference model uses acceleration = netForce / vehicleMass, not power/(mass*velocity). The formula is different.\n9. **Defines calculation Velocity with inputs**  \n   - **Supported**: The reference model has updateSpeedPosition with inputs timeStep, speed, acceleration.\n10. **Velocity: return SpeedValue = v0 + a * dt**  \n    - **Supported**: The reference model uses nextSpeed = speed + acceleration * timeStep.\n11. **Defines calculation Position with inputs**  \n    - **Supported**: The reference model has updateSpeedPosition with inputs timeStep, position, speed.\n12. **Position: return LengthValue = x0 + v * dt**  \n    - **Supported**: The reference model uses nextPosition = position + speed * timeStep.\n\n#### **C.

Input `delta_t: TimeValue`  \n        - **Supported**: The reference model uses timeStep.\n    - 15b. Input `currState: DynamicState`  \n        - **Supported**: The reference model tracks current speed and position.\n    - 15c. Attribute `totalPower: PowerValue = Power(wheelPower, C_d, C_f, mass, currState.v)`  \n        - **Supported**: The reference model computes netForce from wheelPower, drag, and rolling resistance.\n    - 15d.

These correspond loosely to the reference's chassisMass, engineMass, and transmissionMass, but not to the specific attribute types (ChassisMass, EngineMass, TransmissionMass). The generated model uses MassValue for all.\n- The generated model defines a MassConstraint that sums partMasses and checks against a massLimit, which is similar in intent to sumTotalMass and checkCompliance, but is not structured as actions and does not use the same attribute/port structure.\n- The generated model does not define ports, interfaces, or actions as in the reference model.\n- The generated model does not define ComplianceStatus or a compliance attribute.\n\n**Covered claims:**\n- 1. ChassisMass attribute: **Partially covered** (Vehicle has chassisMass: MassValue, but not as a separate type).\n- 2. EngineMass attribute: **Partially covered** (engine.mass: MassValue).\n- 3. TransmissionMass attribute: **Partially covered** (transmission.mass: MassValue).\n- 33. sumTotalMass: **Partially covered** (MassConstraint sums partMasses).\n- 34. checkCompliance: **Partially covered** (MassConstraint checks sum <= massLimit).\n\nHowever, per the instructions, only claims that are \"the same or equivalent\" are to be counted as covered. The generated model does not use the same structure (no ports, no actions, no explicit flows, no ComplianceStatus), but it does model the core idea: summing masses and checking against a limit.\n\nLet's be strict and only count claims that are clearly covered:\n\n- Vehicle has chassisMass, engine.mass, transmission.mass: **Covers the existence of mass attributes for chassis, engine, and transmission.** (Claims 1, 2, 3)\n- MassConstraint sums partMasses and checks against a limit: **Covers the idea of summing masses and checking compliance.** (Claims 33, 34)\n\nSo, **claims 1, 2, 3, 33, 34** are covered, albeit with some abstraction.\n\n**Total claims in reference model:** 34  \n**Number of covered claims:** 5\n\n**Score: 5/34**"

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\n#### 1.

Attribute definition for `CylinderDiameter`.\n- **Generated Model:** There is an attribute definition `Diameter :> ISQ::LengthValue` and a variation attribute `DiameterChoices :> Diameter`.\n- **Coverage:** The concept of a diameter attribute is present, but not as a type named `CylinderDiameter`. However, the type system is present and the variation attribute covers the possible values.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 3. Part definition `Cylinder` with attribute `diameter: CylinderDiameter`.\n- **Generated Model:** `part def Cylinder { attribute diameter : Diameter[1]; }`\n- **Coverage:** Yes (the attribute is present, though the type is `Diameter` instead of `CylinderDiameter`, but semantically equivalent).\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 4. Part definition `Engine` with part `cylinders: Cylinder [4..6]`.\n- **Generated Model:** `part def Engine { part cylinder : Cylinder[2..*]; }`\n- **Coverage:** Part is present, but multiplicity is `[2..*]` instead of `[4..6]`.\n- **Covered:** **Partially**. The structure is present, but the multiplicity is not as restrictive as in the reference model. For recall, we check if the claim is present at all, so this is a **Yes** (since `[4..6]` is a subset of `[2..*]`).\n\n#### 5.

Part `cylinderInstance: Cylinder` with `diameter: CylinderDiameter`.\n- **Generated Model:** There is no explicit part named `cylinderInstance`, but the model allows for instances of `Cylinder` with a diameter attribute, and the variation attribute covers the possible values.\n- **Coverage:** **Partially**. The ability to instantiate a `Cylinder` with a diameter is present, but there is no explicit `cylinderInstance` part.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.\n\n**Claim 1:** The model defines a library package named 'RiskandFailureModelingLibrary'.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model uses 'RiskManagementSystem' as the package name. (Naming differences are ignored, but 'library package' vs 'package' is not a structural/semantic difference.)\n\n**Claim 2:** The model imports ScalarValues::Real privately.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not mention imports or the type 'Real'.\n\n**Claim 3:** The model imports RiskMetadata::Level privately.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not mention imports or the type 'Level'.\n\n**Claim 4:** The model defines an abstract occurrence 'Situation'.  \n- **Supported?** Yes. The reference model defines an attribute 'Situation'.\n\n**Claim 5:** The model defines an abstract occurrence collection 'situations' of type Situation[*] nonunique.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define a collection of 'Situation' occurrences.\n\n**Claim 6:** The model defines an abstract occurrence 'Cause' with an attribute 'probability' of type Real.  \n- **Supported?** Partially. The reference model defines 'Cause' and 'Probability' as separate attributes, not as an attribute of 'Cause'. So, the definition of 'Cause' is supported, but the attribute 'probability' inside 'Cause' is not.\n\n**Claim 7:** The model defines an abstract occurrence collection 'causes' of type Cause[*] nonunique, which is a subtype of 'situations'.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define such a collection or this inheritance.\n\n**Claim 8:** The model defines an abstract occurrence 'Failure' with an attribute 'severity' of type Level.  \n- **Supported?** Partially. The reference model defines 'Failure' and 'SeverityLevel' as separate attributes, not as an attribute of 'Failure'. So, the definition of 'Failure' is supported, but the attribute 'severity' inside 'Failure' is not.\n\n**Claim 9:** The model defines an abstract occurrence collection 'failures' of type Failure[*] nonunique, which is a subtype of 'situations'.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define such a collection or this inheritance.\n\n**Claim 10:** The model defines an abstract connection 'Causation' as a subtype of Occurrences::HappensBefore, with two ends: 'cause' and 'effect', both of type Situation[*].  \n- **Supported?** Partially. The reference model models causal relationships (via ports and flows), but not as a direct connection type with these ends. The concept is present, but the structure is different.\n\n**Claim 11:** The model defines an abstract connection collection 'causations' of type Causation[*] nonunique.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define such a collection.\n\n**Claim 12a:** The model defines an item 'Scenario' with occurrence :>> situations.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define an item 'Scenario' or this occurrence.\n\n**Claim 12b:** The model defines an item 'Scenario' with occurrence :>> causes :> situations.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define this.\n\n**Claim 12c:** The model defines an item 'Scenario' with occurrence :>> failures :> situations.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define this.\n\n**Claim 13:** The model defines an item collection 'scenarios' of type Scenario[*] nonunique.  \n- **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define this.\n\n---\n\n#### Let's clarify the partial claims:\n\n- **Claim 6:** 'Cause' is supported, but 'probability' as an attribute of 'Cause' is not. So, as an atomic claim, this is **not supported**.\n- **Claim 8:** 'Failure' is supported, but 'severity' as an attribute of 'Failure' is not. So, as an atomic claim, this is **not supported**.\n- **Claim 10:** The idea of a causal connection is present, but not as a direct connection type with 'cause' and 'effect' ends. Since the structure is different, this is **not supported**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Summarize the results\n\n#### **Supported Claims**\n\nUpon review, the only claims that are even partially supported are:\n\n- 8. Defines abstract occurrence `Failure` with attribute `severity: Level` (**Partial**: reference model has `SeverityLevel` and `Risk`, but not a `Failure` abstraction)\n- 10. Defines abstract connection `Causation` (subtype of `Occurrences::HappensBefore`) with ends `cause: Situation[*]`, `effect: Situation[*]` (**Partial**: reference model has succession flows)\n- 20. Defines part `Device` with part `battery` (**Partial**: reference model has `battery` part, but not under `Device`)\n- 26. Scenario defines causation: first `'battery old'` then `'power low'` (**Partial**: reference model has succession flows)\n- 27. Scenario defines situation `'power low'` with constraint `{ device.battery.power < minPower }` (**Partial**: reference model has low battery state, but not this constraint)\n- 28. Scenario defines causation: first `'power low'` then `'device shutoff'` (**Partial**: reference model has flow from low battery to shutdown)\n- 29. Scenario defines failure `'device shutoff'` with `severity = LevelEnum::high` (**Partial**: reference model has shutdown and severity, but not as a failure instance)\n\nHowever, none of these are fully supported as atomic claims; they are only loosely related or partially mapped. The reference model is more process/action/flow-oriented, while the generated model is more event/cause/failure-oriented.\n\n**Strictly, none of the atomic claims in the generated model are fully supported by the reference model.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score**\n\n**Score: 0/29**\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| # | Atomic Claim | Supported? | Notes |\n|---|--------------|------------|-------|\n| 1-3 | Imports | No | Not present |\n| 4-13 | Occurrence/Scenario abstractions | No | Not present |\n| 14-19 | Metadata | No | Not present |\n| 20 | Device part | Partial | Only `battery` part exists |\n| 21 | battery.power | No | Not present |\n| 22-29 | Scenario instance | Partial | Only loose mapping to flows, not explicit |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe generated model's atomic claims are not supported by the reference model. The two models use different abstractions and modeling approaches, so there is no direct structural or semantic match for any atomic claim.\n\n---\n\n**Score: 0/29**",

Let's count as covered.\n- Claim 26: 'Car' as alias for 'Automobile' exists (though not as a part, but as an alias). Let's count as covered.\n- Claim 4: 'Torque' as alias for 'ISQ::TorqueValue' exists (though not as a type definition, but as an alias).

The model defines a package named 'ImportPackageExercise'.\n- **Reference:** The reference model defines a package named 'AutomobileSystem'.\n- **Supported?** **No** (package name is different; package existence is not a modeling claim about system structure, but the name is not supported).\n\n#### 2. The model imports 'ISQ::TorqueValue' as a public import.\n- **Reference:** The reference model defines 'TorqueValue' as an attribute, but does not show any import from 'ISQ::TorqueValue'.\n- **Supported?** **No** (the reference model does not show this import; it defines 'TorqueValue' directly).\n\n#### 3. The model imports everything from 'ScalarValues' as a private import.\n- **Reference:** No mention of 'ScalarValues' or such an import.\n- **Supported?** **No**\n\n#### 4. The model defines a private part named 'Automobile'.\n- **Reference:** The reference model defines an attribute 'Automobile' and a part 'automobile' (lowercase) in the context. The generated model defines a part 'Automobile' (uppercase).\n- **Supported?** **Yes** (the reference model defines 'automobile' as a part; case difference is ignored per instructions).\n\n#### 5. The model defines a public alias 'Car' for 'Automobile'.\n- **Reference:** The reference model defines 'Car' as an attribute alias for 'Automobile', and in the context, 'automobile' has alias 'Car'.\n- **Supported?** **Yes** (the alias relationship is present).\n\n#### 6. The model defines an alias 'Torque' for 'ISQ::TorqueValue'.\n- **Reference:** The reference model defines 'Torque' as an attribute alias for 'TorqueValue'. The generated model aliases 'Torque' to 'ISQ::TorqueValue', which is not directly present in the reference, but 'TorqueValue' is the base type.\n- **Supported?** **Yes** (assuming 'ISQ::TorqueValue' is equivalent to 'TorqueValue' in the reference model, as per instructions to ignore identifier differences if semantics match).\n\n### 3.
