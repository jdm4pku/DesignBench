It emphasizes flexibility, scalability, modularity, and the ability to generate vehicle system configurations for diverse needs. However, it does **not** provide any concrete modeling elements, types, parts, actions, ports, variations, or constraints. It is purely descriptive and does not specify any structural or behavioral elements.\n\n#### Evaluation\n\nGiven that the reference model does **not** contain any explicit modeling elements, **none** of the atomic claims in the generated model are directly supported by the reference model.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\nNow, does the generated model contain the same or equivalent element as \"SENSOR_MASS_MAXIMUM_MASS\"?\n\nLet's search for any definition, attribute, requirement, or constant that is named \"SENSOR_MASS_MAXIMUM_MASS\" or is clearly equivalent (e.g., a maximum mass for a sensor).\n\nLooking through the generated model, we see:\n\n- There are requirements and attributes related to \"mass\", such as:\n  - `attribute massActual :> ISQ::mass;`\n  - `attribute massReqd :> ISQ::mass;`\n  - `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass;`\n  - Constraints like `massActual <= massReqd`\n  - Assignments like `massReqd = 2500 [SI::kg];`\n\nBut **nowhere** is there any mention of \"SENSOR_MASS_MAXIMUM_MASS\", nor is there any attribute or constant that is specifically the maximum mass a sensor can measure.\n\nThe only \"maximum mass\" in the generated model is the required mass for a vehicle (`massReqd = 2500 [SI::kg];`), but this is not a sensor property, nor is it named or described as \"SENSOR_MASS_MAXIMUM_MASS\".\n\nThere is a \"Scale\" part, but it does not have a maximum mass attribute or requirement.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNone of the 8 atomic claims (\"SENSOR_MASS_MAXIMUM_MASS\") are covered by the generated model.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

There is no explicit \"started\" state, but there is a `starting` and an `on` state. The reference claim is a constraint that the vehicle is not in the \"started\" state. Since the generated model does not define a \"started\" state, but does define a \"starting\" and \"on\" state, it's ambiguous whether \"started\" refers to \"starting\" or \"on\". However, since the model does not define a \"started\" state, the claim is not directly covered.\n\n#### Claim 3: The vehicle is not in the stopped state.\n\n- **Covered?** The generated model does not define a \"stopped\" state for the vehicle. The states are `off`, `starting`, and `on`. Therefore, the claim that the vehicle is not in the \"stopped\" state is vacuously true (since such a state does not exist in the model). However, the model does not explicitly state that the vehicle cannot be in a \"stopped\" state; it simply does not define such a state.

List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model.\n\nFrom the reference model description, the atomic claims are:\n\n1. The model is a SysMLv2 text model.\n2. The model defines a vehicle with the following parameters:\n    - weight\n    - load\n    - wheel diameter\n    - transmission efficiency\n3. The vehicle's weight is set to the value of the vehicle's weight parameter.\n4. The vehicle's load is set to the value of the vehicle's load parameter.\n5.

Definition of a vehicle part/type.\n- **Covered**: The generated model defines `part def Vehicle`.\n\n#### 2. Declaration of a weight parameter for the vehicle.\n- **Partially covered**: The generated model defines `attribute mass : MassValue;` in `Vehicle`. \"Weight\" is not explicitly present, but \"mass\" is, and in engineering, weight is mass × gravity. If the model uses \"mass\" as the parameter for weight, this is a reasonable mapping.\n- **Covered** (accepting mass as weight).\n\n#### 3. Declaration of a load parameter for the vehicle.\n- **Partially covered**: The generated model defines `attribute cargoMass : MassValue;` in `Vehicle`. \"Load\" is not explicitly present, but \"cargoMass\" is a reasonable mapping for \"load\".\n- **Covered** (accepting cargoMass as load).\n\n#### 4. Declaration of a wheel diameter parameter for the vehicle.\n- **Covered**: The generated model defines `attribute wheelDiameter : LengthValue;` in `Vehicle`.\n\n#### 5. Declaration of a transmission efficiency parameter for the vehicle.\n- **Covered**: The generated model defines `attribute driveTrainEfficiency : Real;` in `Vehicle`. \"Drive train efficiency\" is equivalent to \"transmission efficiency\".\n\n#### 6. The vehicle's weight is set to the value of the weight parameter.\n- **Covered**: The generated model's `Vehicle` part has a `mass` attribute, which is used in the analysis and constraints. The value is set via instantiation (e.g., `vehicle_c1 : Vehicle { ... }`), so the model supports setting this value.\n\n#### 7. The vehicle's load is set to the value of the load parameter.\n- **Covered**: The generated model's `Vehicle` part has a `cargoMass` attribute, which is settable via instantiation.\n\n#### 8. The vehicle's wheel diameter is set to the value of the wheel diameter parameter.\n- **Covered**: The generated model's `Vehicle` part has a `wheelDiameter` attribute, which is settable via instantiation and is set in the analysis (e.g., `vehicle.wheelDiameter == 33 ['in']`).\n\n#### 9. The vehicle's transmission efficiency is set to the value of the transmission efficiency parameter.\n- **Covered**: The generated model's `Vehicle` part has a `driveTrainEfficiency` attribute, which is settable via instantiation and is set in the analysis (e.g., `vehicle.driveTrainEfficiency == 0.4`).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The powertrain component is a logical layer of torque.\n5. The powertrain component is a logical layer of power (repeated).\n6. The powertrain component is a logical layer of torque (repeated).\n7. ... (This alternation of \"logical layer of power\" and \"logical layer of torque\" continues many times.)\n\nGiven the repetitive nature, let's clarify: The reference model seems to be describing a powertrain component that is composed of alternating logical layers of \"power\" and \"torque\"—repeated many times, but fundamentally, the atomic claims are:\n\n- Existence of a logical model.\n- Existence of a powertrain component within the logical model.\n- The powertrain component is composed of logical layers of \"power\" and \"torque\" (alternating, possibly multiple times).\n\nFor the purpose of atomic claims, we can enumerate:\n\n1. Definition of a logical model.\n2. Definition of a powertrain component within the logical model.\n3. The powertrain component contains a logical layer of power.\n4. The powertrain component contains a logical layer of torque.\n5. The powertrain component contains a logical layer of power (repeat).\n6. The powertrain component contains a logical layer of torque (repeat).\n7. ... (and so on, for each alternation).\n\nBut since the model is just repeating the same two claims (power, torque) many times, and since atomic claims should be minimal and meaningful, we can collapse the repeated claims into two unique claims:\n\n- The powertrain component contains a logical layer of power.\n- The powertrain component contains a logical layer of torque.\n\nSo, the atomic claims are:\n\n1. There is a logical model.\n2. The logical model contains a powertrain component.\n3. The powertrain component contains a logical layer of power.\n4.

The mapping is not exact, but the logical model defines a torque generator, and the physical model defines a powertrain. The allocation links the logical and physical. The closest mapping is that the logical model contains a torque generator, and the physical model contains a powertrain. The reference model says the logical model contains a powertrain component, but the generated model splits this between logical and physical. Given the allocation, this is **covered**.\n\n3. **The powertrain component contains a logical layer of power.**\n   - **Covered:** In the generated model, `action def ProvidePower;` and `action providePower : ProvidePower { ... }` are defined in the logical model, and `torqueGenerator` performs `providePower.generateTorque`. This models the provision of power as a logical action within the logical model, associated with the torque generator (which is the logical component). So, **covered**.\n\n4. **The powertrain component contains a logical layer of torque.**\n   - **Covered:** Similarly, `action def GenerateTorque;` and `action generateTorque : GenerateTorque;` are defined, and the logical model's `torqueGenerator` performs `providePower.generateTorque`.

So, this claim is **covered**.\n\n#### 4. The driver is not a mandatory requirement.\n- The generated model does not define a `driver` part at all. Since it is not present, it cannot be a mandatory requirement. So, this claim is **covered**.\n\n#### 5.
