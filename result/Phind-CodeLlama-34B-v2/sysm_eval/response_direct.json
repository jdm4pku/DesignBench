However, the structure is not the same: in the generated model, `TrailerHitch` contains `hitchBall` and `trailerCoupler` as parts, but there is no explicit flow port.\n\n8. **`Hitch` has a flow port `couplingBall` of type `CouplingBall`.**  \n   - **Not covered.** In the generated model, `TrailerHitch` has a part `hitchBall: HitchBall`, but not a flow port.\n\n9. **Definition of block `CouplingBall`.**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def HitchBall;` in Definitions.\n\n10. **There is a connection between `Vehicle.hitch.couplingBall` and `Trailer.hitch.couplingBall`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** There is a binding connector between `vehicle1_c1.hitchBall` and `trailerHitch.hitchBall`, which is similar, but since the structure of the model is different (no `hitch` part in `Vehicle` or `Trailer`), this is not an exact match, but the intent (connecting the two coupling balls) is present.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Fully covered: 1 (Vehicle), 4 (Trailer), 9 (CouplingBall)\n- Partially covered: 7 (Hitch), 10 (connection)\n- Not covered: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8\n\nIf we count only fully covered claims: 3/10  \nIf we count partials as 0.5: 3 + 0.5 (Hitch) + 0.5 (connection) = 4/10\n\n**Final Score: 4/10** (counting partials as 0.5 each)\n\n---\n\n**Score: 4/10**"

        "sysm_eval_r": "**Step 1: List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model.**\n\nLet's enumerate each minimal, meaningful modeling element in the reference model:\n\n### Package\n1. There is a package named `VehicleDynamicSimulation`.\n\n### Blocks and their attributes/parts/operations\n\n#### Block: Vehicle\n2. There is a block named `Vehicle`.\n3. `Vehicle` has an attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n4. `Vehicle` has an attribute `position` of type `Real`.\n5. `Vehicle` has an attribute `velocity` of type `Real`.\n6. `Vehicle` has an attribute `acceleration` of type `Real`.\n\n#### Block: Road\n7. There is a block named `Road`.\n8. `Road` has an attribute `slope` of type `Real`.\n9. `Road` has an attribute `frictionCoefficient` of type `Real`.\n\n#### Block: Simulation\n10. There is a block named `Simulation`.\n11. `Simulation` has an attribute `time` of type `Real`.\n12. `Simulation` has an attribute `vehicle` of type `Vehicle`.\n13. `Simulation` has an attribute `road` of type `Road`.\n14. `Simulation` has an operation `simulate()`.\n15. `Simulation` has an operation `recordSnapshot()`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.**\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n### 1. There is a package named `VehicleDynamicSimulation`.\n- **Not covered.** The generated model's top-level package is named `'VehicleDynamicsTemporalSimulation'`. The name is different, but if we ignore naming, the presence of a top-level package is covered. However, the specific name is not matched, but per instructions, naming differences can be ignored if structure/semantics match. **Covered.**\n\n### 2. There is a block named `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered.** There is a part definition `VehicleA` in the generated model, which clearly corresponds to `Vehicle`.\n\n### 3. `Vehicle` has an attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Partially covered.** `VehicleA` has `mass : MassValue`. The type is not `Real`, but `MassValue` is likely a domain-specific type for mass, which is semantically equivalent. **Covered.**\n\n### 4. `Vehicle` has an attribute `position` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered.** `VehicleA` has `position : Real`.\n\n### 5. `Vehicle` has an attribute `velocity` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered.** `VehicleA` has `velocity : Real`.\n\n### 6. `Vehicle` has an attribute `acceleration` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered.** `VehicleA` has `acceleration : Real`.\n\n### 7. There is a block named `Road`.\n- **Covered.** There is a part definition `Road`.\n\n### 8. `Road` has an attribute `slope` of type `Real`.\n- **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `Road` has `angle : Real`. The reference model uses `slope`, while the generated model uses `angle`. In the context of roads, \"slope\" and \"angle\" are often equivalent (slope is the tangent of the angle). Given the context, this is a reasonable mapping. **Covered.**\n\n### 9. `Road` has an attribute `frictionCoefficient` of type `Real`.\n- **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `Road` has `surfaceFriction : Real`. \"frictionCoefficient\" and \"surfaceFriction\" are semantically equivalent in this context. **Covered.**\n\n### 10. There is a block named `Simulation`.\n- **Not covered.** There is no part definition or block named `Simulation` or equivalent in the generated model.\n\n### 11. `Simulation` has an attribute `time` of type `Real`.\n- **Partially covered.** There is no `Simulation` block, but there are attributes like `t : TimeValue` in `VehicleRoadContext` and `referenceTime : DateTime` in `Temporal-Spatial Reference`. The concept of simulation time is present, but not as an attribute of a `Simulation` block. **Not covered.**\n\n### 12. `Simulation` has an attribute `vehicle` of type `Vehicle`.\n- **Not covered.** There is no `Simulation` block, so this attribute is not present.\n\n### 13. `Simulation` has an attribute `road` of type `Road`.\n- **Not covered.** There is no `Simulation` block, so this attribute is not present.\n\n### 14. `Simulation` has an operation `simulate()`.\n- **Not covered.** There is no operation or method named `simulate()` or equivalent in the generated model.\n\n### 15. `Simulation` has an operation `recordSnapshot()`.\n- **Not covered.** There is no operation or method named `recordSnapshot()` or equivalent in the generated model.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- 1. Top-level package: **Covered**\n- 2. Vehicle block: **Covered**\n- 3. Vehicle.mass: **Covered**\n- 4. Vehicle.position: **Covered**\n- 5. Vehicle.velocity: **Covered**\n- 6. Vehicle.acceleration: **Covered**\n- 7. Road block: **Covered**\n- 8. Road.slope: **Covered**\n- 9. Road.frictionCoefficient: **Covered**\n- 10. Simulation block: **Not covered**\n- 11. Simulation.time: **Not covered**\n- 12. Simulation.vehicle: **Not covered**\n- 13. Simulation.road: **Not covered**\n- 14. Simulation.simulate(): **Not covered**\n- 15.

Definition of block `Transmission`.\n- **Covered**: `part def Transmission;` in `DesignModel`.\n\n#### 4. `Transmission` has attribute `type` of type `String`.\n- **Not Covered**: No attribute `type` or equivalent in `Transmission` in the generated model.

Definition of block `Wheels`.\n- **Covered**: `part def Wheel;` in `DesignModel`. (Note: pluralization difference is ignored.)\n\n#### 6. `Wheels` has attribute `width` of type `Integer`.\n- **Not Covered**: No attribute `width` or equivalent in `Wheel` in the generated model.

Definition of block `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered**: `part def Vehicle;` in `DesignModel`.\n\n#### 8. `Vehicle` has part `engine` of type `Engine`.\n- **Covered**: `part engine : Engine[1]` in `vehicle : Vehicle`.\n\n#### 9. `Vehicle` has part `transmission` of type `Transmission`.\n- **Covered**: `part transmission : Transmission[1]` in `vehicle : Vehicle`.\n\n#### 10. `Vehicle` has part `wheels` of type `Wheels`.\n- **Partially Covered**: In the generated model, `vehicle` has a `rearAxleAssembly` with `rearWheels : Wheel[2]`. There is no direct `wheels` part, but the structure is similar (wheels as parts of the vehicle). For recall, this is **Covered**.\n\n#### 11. `Vehicle` has constraint `performance`: `engine.cylinder > 4 and transmission.type = \"automatic\" and wheels.width > 16`.\n- **Covered (Semantically)**: In the generated model, the `highPerformanceRequirement` is mapped to `6CylEngine`, `AutomaticTransmission`, and `WideRimWheel` (see constraints in `VariabilityModel`). The logic is equivalent, though not expressed as attribute values but as variant selections.\n\n#### 12. `Vehicle` has constraint `compatibility`: `engine.cylinder = 4 and transmission.type = \"manual\" and wheels.width <= 16`.\n- **Covered (Semantically)**: Similarly, the `normalPerformanceRequirement` is mapped to `4CylEngine`, `ManualTransmission`, and `NarrowRimWheel`. The logic is equivalent.\n\n#### 13. Definition of block `ProductLine`.\n- **Not Covered**: There is no explicit `ProductLine` block in the generated model. The closest is the variability model and the package structure, but not a direct block.\n\n#### 14. `ProductLine` has part `vehicles` of type `Vehicle[*]` (multiplicity: many).\n- **Not Covered**: There is no explicit part `vehicles` of type `Vehicle[*]`. The generated model defines `vehicleChoice` as a variation over `anyVehicleConfig`, but not as a part of a `ProductLine` block.\n\n#### 15. `ProductLine` has constraint `configuration` (logic: for each vehicle, if performance, set engine.cylinder=6, transmission.type=\"automatic\", wheels.width=18, else ...).\n- **Covered (Semantically)**: The generated model encodes this logic via the variation and constraints in the `VariabilityModel` package, mapping requirements to variant selections.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The name is different (`mass` vs `actualMass`), but the semantics are equivalent (vehicle's actual mass). **Covered.**\n\n5. **Definition of block `ComplianceSystem`.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model defines `part def MassVerificationSystem;` and `part massVerificationSystem : MassVerificationSystem { ... }` which plays the role of the compliance system. The name is different, but the structure and semantics match. **Covered.**\n\n6. **Definition of part `testOperator : TestOperator` in `ComplianceSystem`.**  \n   - **Covered.** In `massVerificationSystem`, there is `part testOperator : TestOperator;`.\n\n7. **Definition of part `vehicle : Vehicle` in `ComplianceSystem`.**  \n   - **Covered.** In `massVerificationSystem`, there is `ref part vehicleUnderTest : Vehicle;` and in usages, `testVehicle` is passed in. This is equivalent.\n\n8. **Definition of attribute `maxPermissibleMass : Real` in `ComplianceSystem`.**  \n   - **Covered.** The requirement `MassRequirement` has `massReqd`, and in usages, `vehicleMassRequirement` sets `massReqd = 2500 [SI::kg]`. This is equivalent.\n\n9. **Definition of operation `testVehicle() : Boolean` in `ComplianceSystem`.**  \n   - **Covered.** The generated model defines a verification `vehicleMassTest` with a return value `verdict : VerdictKind`, which is equivalent to a Boolean result.\n\n10. **In `testVehicle()`, assignment: `vehicle.actualMass = testOperator.measureMass()`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model's `collectData` action collects `massMeasured` from `testVehicle.mass`, and the `scale` part performs the measurement. The explicit assignment from `testOperator.measureMass()` is not present, but the measurement process is modeled via the `scale` and `collectData`. The role of `TestOperator` in measurement is less direct, but the measurement process is present. **Covered (semantically equivalent, though not identical).**\n\n11. **In `testVehicle()`, return value: `vehicle.actualMass <= maxPermissibleMass`.**  \n    - **Covered.** The requirement and verification process in the generated model checks `massActual <= massReqd`, which is equivalent.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- 1.

The block defines a parameter `minTiltAngle` of type `Real` with default value 50.\n- **Partially covered.** The generated model has a constraint that uses the value 50 as a lower bound for `angle`, but does not define a parameter named `minTiltAngle` or an equivalent attribute.\n\n#### 4.

The block defines an input `tiltAngle` of type `Real`.\n- **Partially covered.** The generated model defines an attribute `angle` (in `LightBeamTiltAngleValue`), which is conceptually similar to `tiltAngle`, but it is not explicitly an input, nor is it of type `Real` (it's of type `LightBeamTiltAngleValue`, which may be based on `PlaneAngleValue`).\n\n#### 6.

However, the structure is equivalent.\n\n7. **`Alloy` has attribute `tensileStrength: Real`**  \n   - **Covered**: `tensileStrength: TensileStrengthValue` in `Steel_980` instance; the type is more specific, but semantically equivalent.\n\n8. **Class `Component`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No explicit `Component` class; but `MaterialFraction` serves the same role.\n\n9. **`Component` has attribute `substance: Substance`**  \n   - **Covered**: `MaterialFraction` has `ref material: Material[1];` which is equivalent.\n\n10. **`Component` has attribute `massFraction: Real`**  \n    - **Covered**: `MaterialFraction` has `attribute massFraction: MassFractionValue[1];`\n\n#### Instances\n\n11. **Substance instance `Iron` with `atomicMass: 55.845`**  \n    - **Covered**: `individual def Iron :> Metal { attribute :>> atomicMass = 55.845 [Da]; }`\n\n12. **Substance instance `Carbon` with `atomicMass: 12.010`**  \n    - **Covered**: `individual def Carbon :> Metal { attribute atomicMass :>> Metal::atomicMass = 12.011[Da]; }` (value is 12.011, reference is 12.010; close enough for recall, so **Covered**).\n\n13. **Substance instance `Manganese` with `atomicMass: 57.938`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: `individual def Manganese :> Metal { attribute atomicMass :>> Metal::atomicMass = 54.938[Da]; }` (value is 54.938, reference is 57.938; this is a significant difference, so **Not Covered**).\n\n#### Alloy Instance\n\n14. **Alloy instance `Steel980`**  \n    - **Covered**: `individual def Steel_980 :> Alloy { ... }`\n\n15. **Steel980 components:**\n    - 15a. **Component 1: Iron, 0.90**  \n        - **Partially Covered**: There is a fraction with `Iron`, but the massFraction is `0.9862` instead of `0.90`. Value is not matching, so **Not Covered**.\n    - 15b. **Component 2: Carbon, 0.08**  \n        - **Partially Covered**: There is a fraction with `Carbon`, but massFraction is `0.9862` instead of `0.08`. **Not Covered**.\n    - 15c. **Component 3: Manganese, 0.02**  \n        - **Partially Covered**: There is a fraction with `Manganese`, but massFraction is `0.9862` instead of `0.02`. **Not Covered**.\n\n16. **Steel980 has tensileStrength: 450.0**  \n    - **Not Covered**: In generated model, `Steel_980` has `tensileStrength: 980['N/mm²']` (value and unit do not match). **Not Covered**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

There is no explicit mapping to StartUp, Shutdown, Running blocks, but the state machine does model a startup process.\n\n**Let's count the covered claims:**\n\n- Claims 8, 16, 24 (vehicleStartSignal in each block): **Partially covered** (attribute exists, and used as a trigger in the state machine, but not as an event in a block). Let's count these as covered, since the event/trigger is present.\n- Claims 28, 29, 32 (transitions and guards): The state machine models a transition from off to starting on VehicleStartSignal, which is similar to a startup transition. Let's count 28 and 29 as covered, since the structure is present (though not named the same). Claim 32 (guard on transition from Shutdown to StartUp) is less clear, as there is no explicit Shutdown state, but the off state could be considered equivalent. Let's count it as covered.\n\nSo, covered claims:\n- 8, 16, 24 (vehicleStartSignal event/trigger in each block)\n- 28 (transition from StartUp to Running ≈ off to starting)\n- 29 (guard vehicleStartSignal on that transition)\n- 32 (guard vehicleStartSignal on transition from Shutdown to StartUp ≈ off to starting)\n\n**Total covered claims: 6**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nScore: 6/32"

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. Definition of block `DriverCommand`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a `Driver` part, but not a `DriverCommand` block. The role of `DriverCommand` seems to be mapped to `Driver`, but the name is different. If we accept semantic equivalence, this is covered.\n- **Covered:** Yes (as `Driver`).\n\n#### 2. Definition of operation `setDesiredSpeed(desiredSpeed: Real)` in `DriverCommand`.\n- **Generated model:** There is an event `setSpeedSent` in `Driver`, and a message `setSpeedMessage` of type `SetSpeed`. The operation is not explicitly defined, but the message and event correspond to the same functionality.\n- **Covered:** Yes (as message/event/action for setting speed).\n\n#### 3. Definition of block `Speedometer`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a `Speedometer` part.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 4. Definition of operation `getCurrentSpeed(): Real` in `Speedometer`.\n- **Generated model:** There is an event `sensedSpeedSent` and a message `sensedSpeedMessage` of type `SensedSpeed` from `Speedometer` to `CruiseController`. This corresponds to the operation, though not as a function but as a message/event.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 5. Definition of block `CruiseController`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a `CruiseController` part.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 6. Definition of operation `calculateThrottleControl(desiredSpeed: Real, currentSpeed: Real): Real` in `CruiseController`.\n- **Generated model:** There is an event `fuelCommandSent` and a message `fuelCommandMessage` of type `FuelCommand` from `CruiseController` to `Engine`. The actual calculation operation is not explicitly defined, but the behavior is implied by the message flow and actions.\n- **Covered:** Yes (semantically, as the controller processes inputs and sends a command).\n\n#### 7. Definition of block `Engine`.\n- **Generated model:** There is an `Engine` part.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 8. Definition of operation `setThrottle(throttle: Real)` in `Engine`.\n- **Generated model:** There is an event `fuelCommandReceived` and a message `fuelCommandMessage` to `Engine`. The operation is not explicitly defined, but the message corresponds to the same functionality.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 9. Flow: `DriverCommand.setDesiredSpeed` -> `CruiseController.calculateThrottleControl`.\n- **Generated model:** Message `setSpeedMessage` from `driver.setSpeedSent` to `vehicle.cruiseController.setSpeedReceived` (i.e., from Driver to CruiseController). This covers the flow.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 10. Flow: `Speedometer.getCurrentSpeed` -> `CruiseController.calculateThrottleControl`.\n- **Generated model:** Message `sensedSpeedMessage` from `vehicle.speedometer.sensedSpeedSent` to `vehicle.cruiseController.sensedSpeedReceived`. This covers the flow.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 11.

For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\n#### 1. There is a class `Component`.\n- **Generated model:** The concept of a basic massed part is represented by `MassedThing`, which is used as a base for other parts. This is equivalent to `Component`.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 2. `Component` has an attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `MassedThing` has `simpleMass :> ISQ::mass`. This is a mass attribute, though the type is more specific (SI mass), but semantically equivalent.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 3. `Component` has an operation `calculateTotalMass(): Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `MassedThing` has `totalMass :> ISQ::mass`, and in `simpleThing`, `totalMass = simpleMass`. This is an attribute, not an operation, but it represents the same concept: the total mass of the component.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 4. There is a class `CompositeComponent` that extends `Component`.\n- **Generated model:** `compositeThing` is a `MassedThing`, representing a composite part. The inheritance is present.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 5. `CompositeComponent` has an attribute `subcomponents` of type `Set(Component)`.\n- **Generated model:** `compositeThing` has `subcomponents: MassedThing[*]`, which is a set of components.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 6. `CompositeComponent` has an operation `calculateTotalMass(): Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `compositeThing` defines `totalMass = simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`. Again, this is an attribute, not an operation, but it represents the same calculation.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 7. There is a class `Vehicle` that extends `CompositeComponent`.\n- **Generated model:** `car` is a `CarPart` (which is a `MassedThing`) and is also a `compositeThing`.

There is no explicit \"coreComponents\", but the structure is equivalent.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 9. There is an operation `calculateVehicleMass(vehicle: Vehicle): Real` (outside of any class).\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit operation for calculating vehicle mass given a vehicle, but the model allows for the calculation of `totalMass` for a `car` instance. The calculation is implicit in the attribute, not as a standalone operation.\n- **Covered:** Yes (the functionality is present, though not as a standalone operation)\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Declaration of part `engineWeight` of type `Real` in `WeightManager`.**  \n- **Partially covered.** The generated model has a part `engine : Engine` with an attribute `mass : MassValue`. This is equivalent to `engineWeight`. **Covered.**\n\n**4. Declaration of part `transmissionWeight` of type `Real` in `WeightManager`.**  \n- **Partially covered.** The generated model has a part `transmission : Engine` (likely a typo, should be `Transmission`) with an attribute `mass : MassValue`. This is equivalent to `transmissionWeight`. **Covered.**\n\n**5. Declaration of part `totalWeight` of type `Real` in `WeightManager`.**  \n- **Partially covered.** The generated model does not have a direct `totalWeight` attribute, but the constraint `massConstraint` uses a sum of masses and compares to a limit, which is functionally equivalent. **Covered.**\n\n**6. Definition of constraint `weightLimit` enforcing `totalWeight <= 2500`.**  \n- **Covered.** The generated model's `MassConstraint` enforces `sum(partMasses) <= massLimit`, and in `Vehicle`, `massLimit` is set to `2500[kg]`. **Covered.**\n\n**7.

There is `mass : MassValue`, which could be equivalent, but `curbWeight` is a specific term (vehicle weight without payload), while `mass` could be total mass. Not a direct match.\n\n3. **Attribute `payload: Real`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No attribute named `payload`. There is `cargoMass : MassValue`, which could be equivalent, but not exact. Let's be lenient: **cargoMass** is equivalent to **payload** (both mean the load carried). **Covered**.\n\n4. **Attribute `wheelDiameter: Real`**  \n   - **Covered**: `wheelDiameter : LengthValue` exists (type is more specific, but semantically matches).\n\n5. **Attribute `transmissionEfficiency: Real`**  \n   - **Covered**: `driveTrainEfficiency : Real` (different name, but same meaning).\n\n6. **Attribute `fuelEconomyUrban: Real`**  \n   - **Covered**: `fuelEconomy_city : DistancePerVolumeValue` (different type, but semantically matches).\n\n7. **Attribute `fuelEconomyHighway: Real`**  \n   - **Covered**: `fuelEconomy_highway : DistancePerVolumeValue` (different type, but semantically matches).\n\n#### Block: DrivingCycle\n\n8. **Definition of block `DrivingCycle`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No block named `DrivingCycle`.

This is functionally equivalent to a driving cycle, but not a block.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a block named `AutomotiveSystem`.\n- **Generated model:** There is no block named `AutomotiveSystem`, but there is a `vehicle` part at the top level, and the package is called `AutomotiveSystemArchitectureSafetyViews`. The structure is similar, but the name is not matched exactly. However, per instructions, naming differences can be ignored if the structure and semantics match. The `vehicle` part is the root of the system.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 2. The block `AutomotiveSystem` is tagged with `{type = FunctionalSafetyDecomposition}`.\n- **Generated model:** The root package is not explicitly tagged as such, nor is the `vehicle` part. There is no explicit tag or stereotype for `FunctionalSafetyDecomposition`.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 3. The block contains a part `s` of type `SeatBelt`, tagged `{type = SafetyComponent}`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle` contains `interior`, which contains `seatBelt[2]` with `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`. The type is not explicitly `SeatBelt`, but the part is named `seatBelt`. The tag is not `{type = SafetyComponent}` but a custom `@Safety` stereotype. The intent is equivalent: marking as a safety component.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 4. The block contains a part `b` of type `Bumper`, tagged `{type = SafetyComponent}`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle` contains `bodyAssy`, which contains `bumper` with `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`. Again, the type is not explicit, but the part name and safety tag are present.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 5. The block contains a part `a` of type `Airbag`, tagged `{type = SafetyComponent, optional}`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle` contains `interior`, which contains `driverAirBag` with `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`. The name is not exactly `Airbag`, but `driverAirBag` is a specific airbag. The tag `isMandatory = false` matches the `optional` aspect.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 6. The block contains a part `ab` of type `ABS`, tagged `{type = SafetyComponent, optional}`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle` contains `wheelAssy`, which contains `antilockBrakes[2]` with `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`. `antilockBrakes` is equivalent to ABS. The optional aspect is covered by `isMandatory = false`.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 7. The block contains a part `e` of type `Engine`, tagged `{type = NonSafetyComponent}`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle` does not contain a part named `engine` or anything similar, nor is there a part with a tag indicating `NonSafetyComponent`.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 8. The block contains a part `t` of type `Transmission`, tagged `{type = NonSafetyComponent}`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle` does not contain a part named `transmission` or anything similar, nor is there a part with a tag indicating `NonSafetyComponent`.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 9. The block contains a part `c` of type `Chassis`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle` does not contain a part named `chassis` or anything similar.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

However, there are specializations: `smallVehicle` redefines `cyl[4]`, `bigVehicle` redefines `cyl[6]`. This captures the mapping from vehicle size to cylinder count, but not the dynamic behavior or the \"else\" case (5 cylinders).  \n   - **Covered:** Partially. The mapping for \"small\" and \"large\" is present as static structure, but not as an operation or for the \"else\" case.
