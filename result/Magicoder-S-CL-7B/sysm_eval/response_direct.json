There is no direct mapping from `p1` to `pa` or `pb` unless we assume a renaming, but the reference model's `p1` is connected to `pe`, and in the generated model, `c1.pb` is bound to `pe`.

In the generated model, `c3.pd` is bound to `pf`. If we allow for naming differences, and since `c3.pd` is the port used for the connection to `pf`, **Yes**.\n\n- **Component c4 has port p4.**  \n  - No: `C4` has no ports defined. **No**.\n\n- **Port c1.p1 is connected to pe.**  \n  - Yes: In the generated model, `port :>> pe = c1.pb` in `b11` binds `c1.pb` to `pe`.

In the generated model, `pe` is a port, not a part with ports. **No**.\n\n- **Interface pf has port pd.**  \n  - No: There is no definition of `pf` having a port `pd`. In the generated model, `pf` is a port, not a part with ports. **No**.\n\n- **Port pe.pb is connected to c1.p1.**  \n  - No: There is no such structure in the generated model. **No**.\n\n- **Port pf.pd is connected to c3.p3.**  \n  - No: There is no such structure in the generated model. **No**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| # | Atomic Claim | Covered? | Notes |\n|---|--------------|----------|-------|\n| 1 | c1 exists | Yes | |\n| 2 | c2 exists | Yes | |\n| 3 | c3 exists | Yes | |\n| 4 | c4 exists | Yes | |\n| 5 | c1 has port p1 | Yes | p1 ≈ pb |\n| 6 | c2 has port p2 | No | |\n| 7 | c3 has port p3 | Yes | p3 ≈ pd |\n| 8 | c4 has port p4 | No | |\n| 9 | c1.p1 connected to pe | Yes | pb bound to pe |\n| 10 | c2.p2 connected to pe | No | |\n| 11 | c3.p3 connected to pf | Yes | pd bound to pf |\n| 12 | c4.p4 connected to pf | No | |\n| 13 | pe exists | Yes | |\n| 14 | pf exists | Yes | |\n| 15 | pe has port pb | No | |\n| 16 | pf has port pd | No | |\n| 17 | pe.pb connected to c1.p1 | No | |\n| 18 | pf.pd connected to c3.p3 | No | |\n\n**Number of covered claims: 8**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\n#### 1. There is a part/entity named `VehicleA` which is a `Vehicle`.\n- **Generated model:** `part def VehicleA` (in Definitions). The type `Vehicle` is not explicitly shown, but `VehicleA` is defined as a part. **Partial coverage** (since the type is not explicit, but the part exists).\n\n#### 2. `VehicleA` has a Statechart named `VehicleStatechart`.\n- **Generated model:** `exhibit state 'vehicle states': 'Vehicle States';` and in Usages, `state 'vehicle states': 'Vehicle States' parallel { ... }` and `exhibit 'vehicle states' :>> VehicleA::'vehicle states'`. The name is different (`vehicle states` vs `VehicleStatechart`), but the structure is equivalent. **Covered**.\n\n#### 3. `VehicleStatechart` has a state named `Off`.\n- **Generated model:** In `state 'vehicle states'`, there is a substate `off`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 4. `VehicleStatechart` has a state named `Starting`.\n- **Generated model:** In `state 'vehicle states'`, there is a substate `starting`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 5. `VehicleStatechart` has a state named `Running`.\n- **Generated model:** In `state 'vehicle states'`, there is a substate `on`. The reference model uses `Running`, the generated model uses `on`. The behavior of `on` matches `Running` (entry/exit actions, transitions). **Covered (semantically equivalent)**.\n\n#### 6. `VehicleStatechart` has a state named `HealthManagement`.\n- **Generated model:** In `state 'vehicle states'`, there is a parallel region `health states` with substates `normal`, `maintenance`, `degraded`. There is no explicit `HealthManagement` state, but the parallel region may correspond to `HealthManagement`. However, the state itself is not named or defined as `HealthManagement`. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 7. `VehicleStatechart` has a state named `Maintenance`.\n- **Generated model:** In `health states`, there is a substate `maintenance`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 8. `VehicleStatechart` has a state named `Degraded`.\n- **Generated model:** In `health states`, there is a substate `degraded`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 9. `VehicleStatechart` has a state named `Normal`.\n- **Generated model:** In `health states`, there is a substate `normal`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 10. Transition: `Off --> Starting` on receipt of a start signal.\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'off-starting' first off accept 'Vehicle Start Signal' ... then starting`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 11. Transition: `Starting --> Running` on receipt of a vehicle-on signal.\n- **Generated model:** `transition 'starting-on' first starting accept 'Vehicle On Signal' then on;` (`on` = `Running`). **Covered**.\n\n#### 12. Transition: `Running --> HealthManagement` when the temperature exceeds a safety threshold.\n- **Generated model:** In the reference, `Running` transitions to `HealthManagement` on over-temperature. In the generated model, in `health states`, there is a transition from `normal` to `degraded` on over-temperature (`accept when 'sense temperature'.temp > vehicle1_c1.Tmax ... then degraded`). However, the transition is not from `on`/`Running` to `health states`, but within `health states`. The mapping is not direct, but the over-temperature transition is present. **Partial coverage** (the transition exists, but the state structure is different).\n\n#### 13. Transition: `Running --> Maintenance` on receipt of a signal to enter maintenance mode.\n- **Generated model:** In `health states`, `transition 'normal-maintenance' first normal accept at vehicle1_c1.maintenanceTime then maintenance;`. The trigger is different (time-based, not a signal), and the transition is from `normal` to `maintenance`, not from `Running` to `Maintenance`. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 14. Transition: `Running --> Degraded` on receipt of a signal to enter degraded mode.\n- **Generated model:** In `health states`, `transition 'normal-degraded' first normal accept when 'sense temperature'.temp > vehicle1_c1.Tmax ... then degraded;`. The trigger is over-temperature, not a signal. No transition from `Running`/`on` to `degraded`. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 15. Transition: `HealthManagement --> Normal`.\n- **Generated model:** In `health states`, `transition 'maintenance-normal' first maintenance accept 'Return to Normal' then normal;` and `transition 'degraded-normal' first degraded accept 'Return to Normal' then normal;`. There is no explicit `HealthManagement` state, but transitions from `maintenance` and `degraded` to `normal` exist. **Partial coverage**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n| # | Claim | Covered? |\n|---|-------|----------|\n| 1 | VehicleA is a Vehicle | Partial (part exists, type not explicit) |\n| 2 | VehicleA has a Statechart | Yes |\n| 3 | Off state | Yes |\n| 4 | Starting state | Yes |\n| 5 | Running state | Yes (as 'on') |\n| 6 | HealthManagement state | No |\n| 7 | Maintenance state | Yes |\n| 8 | Degraded state | Yes |\n| 9 | Normal state | Yes |\n|10 | Off->Starting transition | Yes |\n|11 | Starting->Running transition | Yes |\n|12 | Running->HealthManagement (over-temp) | Partial (transition exists, structure different) |\n|13 | Running->Maintenance (signal) | No |\n|14 | Running->Degraded (signal) | No |\n|15 | HealthManagement->Normal | Partial (no explicit state, but transitions from maintenance/degraded to normal) |\n\n**Scoring:**\n- Fully covered: 10 (claims 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n- Partial: 3 (claims 1, 12, 15)\n- Not covered: 3 (claims 6, 13, 14)\n\nIf we count partial as not fully covered (i.e., only count full coverage), the score is **9/15**.\n\nIf we count partial as 0.5, the score is **9 + 0.5*3 = 10.5/15**.\n\n**Per instructions, only count as covered if the element is present or equivalent.

However, in the context of the requirement, `massActual` is mapped to `vehicle.mass`.\n- **Covered:** Yes (semantically equivalent)\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has an attribute/property for `maxPermissibleMass`.\n\n- **Generated Model:** The requirement `MassRequirement` defines `massReqd` (required mass), and in the usage, `massReqd = 2500 [SI::kg]`. However, the `Vehicle` part itself does not have a `maxPermissibleMass` attribute; the permissible mass is specified externally in the requirement, not as a property of the vehicle.\n- **Covered:** No (not as a property of the vehicle; only as a requirement parameter)\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle` has a method/operation to check compliance: `isCompliant()` (i.e., checks if `actualMass <= maxPermissibleMass`).\n\n- **Generated Model:** The requirement `MassRequirement` expresses `massActual <= massReqd`, and the verification process checks this for a vehicle.\n- **Covered:** Yes (semantically, via requirement and verification)\n\n#### 5. Definition of a `VehicleTestSystem` class/type.\n\n- **Generated Model:** `part def MassVerificationSystem;` and `part massVerificationSystem : MassVerificationSystem { ... }`\n- **Covered:** Yes (semantically equivalent)\n\n#### 6. `VehicleTestSystem` has an attribute/property: a collection of `Vehicle` instances (e.g., `vehicles` array/pointer).\n\n- **Generated Model:** The system refers to vehicles under test, e.g., `ref part vehicleUnderTest : Vehicle;` and in the test system, there are two vehicles tested in sequence (`TestVehicle1`, `TestVehicle2`). However, there is no explicit collection/array of vehicles as a property of the system; instead, the system is tested with one vehicle at a time.\n- **Covered:** Partially, but not as an explicit collection property. The model supports multiple vehicles via test cases, but not as a system attribute.\n- **Covered:** No (not as a property/attribute; only as test instances)\n\n#### 7. `VehicleTestSystem` has an attribute/property: `numVehicles` (number of vehicles).\n\n- **Generated Model:** No explicit property for the number of vehicles.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n#### 8. `VehicleTestSystem` has a method/operation to check if all vehicles are compliant: `isAllCompliant()` (i.e., iterates over vehicles and checks compliance).\n\n- **Generated Model:** The verification is performed per vehicle, with two test cases, but there is no explicit operation that checks all vehicles in a collection for compliance.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n---\n\n### 3.

        "sysm_eval_r": "**Step 1: List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model.**\n\nThe reference model is a C++ class for a Blood Glucose Meter. The atomic claims are:\n\n1. Definition of a class named `BloodGlucoseMeter`.\n2. The class has a private attribute `batteryStatus` of type `bool`.\n3. The class has a private attribute `batteryCharge` of type `bool`.\n4. The class has a private attribute `glucoseMeasurement` of type `bool`.\n5. The class has a public constructor that initializes all three attributes to `true`.\n6. The class has a public method `checkBatteryStatus()`.\n7. The method `checkBatteryStatus()` checks if `batteryCharge` is `false`, and if so, sets `batteryStatus` to `false` and calls `alertUser()`.\n8. The class has a public method `alertUser()`.\n9. The class has a public method `checkGlucoseMeasurement()`.\n10. The method `checkGlucoseMeasurement()` checks if `glucoseMeasurement` is `false` and handles the failure scenario.\n11. In `main()`, an instance of `BloodGlucoseMeter` is created.\n12. In `main()`, `checkBatteryStatus()` is called on the instance.\n13. In `main()`, `checkGlucoseMeasurement()` is called on the instance.\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.**\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n1. **Definition of a class named `BloodGlucoseMeter`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** There is no explicit class named `BloodGlucoseMeter`, but there is a part 'glucose meter' in the FMEA item 'Glucose Meter in Use'. This is a partial match, but not a direct class definition.  \n   - **Coverage:** **Partial/No** (not a direct class definition, but a part with the same name exists).\n\n2. **Private attribute `batteryStatus` of type `bool`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** No explicit attribute `batteryStatus` of type `bool`. There are events and causes related to battery, but not this attribute.  \n   - **Coverage:** **No**\n\n3. **Private attribute `batteryCharge` of type `bool`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** No explicit attribute `batteryCharge` of type `bool`.  \n   - **Coverage:** **No**\n\n4. **Private attribute `glucoseMeasurement` of type `bool`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** No explicit attribute, but there is an event 'glucose level undetected' under 'glucose meter', which is conceptually related.  \n   - **Coverage:** **Partial/No** (event is related, but not an attribute).\n\n5. **Public constructor initializing all three attributes to `true`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** No constructors or initializations.  \n   - **Coverage:** **No**\n\n6. **Public method `checkBatteryStatus()`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** No explicit method, but there is a cause 'battery depleted', a failure 'battery cannot be charged', and a prevention connection to a requirement about battery alarm. This is a functional mapping, but not a method.  \n   - **Coverage:** **Partial/No** (functionality is modeled, but not as a method).\n\n7. **`checkBatteryStatus()` checks if `batteryCharge` is `false`, sets `batteryStatus` to `false`, and calls `alertUser()`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** The FMEA chain models battery depletion leading to failure and an alarm requirement, but not as a method or with attribute manipulation.  \n   - **Coverage:** **Partial/No** (the scenario is modeled, but not as code logic).\n\n8. **Public method `alertUser()`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** There is a requirement with documentation \"Alarm when battery has sank\", and a prevention connection, which is conceptually similar to alerting the user.  \n   - **Coverage:** **Partial** (requirement for alarm, but not a method).\n\n9. **Public method `checkGlucoseMeasurement()`.**  \n   - **Generated model:** There is an event 'glucose level undetected' and a failure chain, but not a method.  \n   - **Coverage:** **Partial/No** (functionality is modeled, but not as a method).\n\n10. **`checkGlucoseMeasurement()` checks if `glucoseMeasurement` is `false` and handles the failure scenario.**  \n    - **Generated model:** The event 'glucose level undetected' and its effect 'therapy delay' model the failure scenario, but not as code logic.  \n    - **Coverage:** **Partial** (failure scenario is modeled).\n\n11. **In `main()`, an instance of `BloodGlucoseMeter` is created.**  \n    - **Generated model:** No explicit instantiation; the model is structural/behavioral, not code.  \n    - **Coverage:** **No**\n\n12. **In `main()`, `checkBatteryStatus()` is called on the instance.**  \n    - **Generated model:** No method calls; only structural/behavioral modeling.  \n    - **Coverage:** **No**\n\n13. **In `main()`, `checkGlucoseMeasurement()` is called on the instance.**  \n    - **Generated model:** No method calls; only structural/behavioral modeling.  \n    - **Coverage:** **No**\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the number of claims that are covered (even partially):\n\n- Claim 1: Partial/No (part exists, but not a class) → **No**\n- Claim 2: No\n- Claim 3: No\n- Claim 4: Partial/No (event is related, but not an attribute) → **No**\n- Claim 5: No\n- Claim 6: Partial/No (functionality is modeled, but not as a method) → **No**\n- Claim 7: Partial/No (scenario is modeled, but not as code logic) → **No**\n- Claim 8: Partial (requirement for alarm, but not a method) → **Yes**\n- Claim 9: Partial/No (functionality is modeled, but not as a method) → **No**\n- Claim 10: Partial (failure scenario is modeled) → **Yes**\n- Claim 11: No\n- Claim 12: No\n- Claim 13: No\n\n**Covered claims:** 2 (claim 8 and claim 10, as the functional intent is present in the generated model, even if not as methods).\n\n**Total claims:** 13\n\n---\n\n**Score: 2/13**"

Definition of part: Person\n- **Not Supported**: Reference model defines \"Personnel\", not \"Person\". (Assuming \"Person\" ≠ \"Personnel\" unless otherwise specified.)\n\n#### 3. Definition of attribute: 'Bag<SparePart>' as a Bag\n- **Supported**: Reference model defines class \"Bag\" with attribute \"spareParts\" of type \"List<SparePart>\". The generated model's \"Bag<SparePart>\" as a Bag is a close match, but not exact. However, since \"Bag\" is a collection type and \"Bag<SparePart>\" is a Bag, this is **Supported**.\n\n#### 4.

Definition of attribute: 'List<Integer>' as a List\n- **Supported**: Reference model defines class \"List\" with attribute \"integers\" of type \"List<integer>\".\n\n#### 6.

If \"Person\" is considered equivalent to \"Personnel\", this would be supported, but as per claim 2, we are not assuming equivalence. So, **Not Supported**.\n\n#### 10.

In the generated model, only `Alloy` has `fractions` (composition), not all `Material`. So, for the general claim about `Material`, **Not covered**.\n\n#### 4. `Material` has an attribute `tensileStrength` of type `double`.\n- **Partially covered.** In the generated model, only `Steel_980` (a specific alloy) has a `tensileStrength` attribute, not the general `Material` class. So, for the general claim about `Material`, **Not covered**.\n\n#### 5. `Material` has a constructor that initializes `name`, `composition`, and `tensileStrength`.\n- **Not covered.** The generated model does not specify constructors or initialization logic.\n\n#### 6. `Material` has a method `printDetails()` that prints the material's details.\n- **Not covered.** The generated model does not specify methods or behavior.\n\n#### 7.

Summarize the results\n\n**Score: 1/8**\n\n- Only the existence of the `Material` class is covered.\n- The generated model is more focused on a type system and specific material instances, but does not cover the general attributes or behaviors of the `Material` class as in the reference model.\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nScore: 1/8"

List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model\n\nFrom the reference model text, the following atomic claims can be extracted:\n\n1. There is a concept called **Scenario**.\n2. **Scenario** describes a potential event or set of events that could occur within the system.\n3. **Scenario** includes a **description** attribute.\n4. **Scenario** includes **causes**.\n5. **Scenario** includes **failure types**.\n6. There is a concept called **Cause**.\n7. **Cause** can be associated with a **probability of occurrence**.\n8. There is a concept called **Failure**.\n9. **Failure** can be associated with a **severity level**.\n10. The system supports the description and tracking of **causal relationships between scenarios** (i.e., scenarios can be causally related).\n11. Users can **combine a set of interrelated scenarios, causes, and failures to form complete risk scenarios** (i.e., risk scenarios are composed of scenarios, causes, and failures).\n12. The system metadata is **compatible with standard modeling languages** (i.e., supports semantic metadata for integration).\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n1. **Concept: Scenario**  \n   - **Covered**: `item def Scenario` and `item scenarios : Scenario[*] nonunique;`\n\n2. **Scenario describes a potential event or set of events**  \n   - **Covered**: `Scenario` is defined as an item, and the description is implied by the model structure (and further by the `occurrence :>> situations;` mapping).\n\n3. **Scenario includes a description attribute**  \n   - **Not Covered**: There is no explicit `description` attribute for `Scenario` in the generated model.\n\n4. **Scenario includes causes**  \n   - **Covered**: `occurrence :>> causes :> situations;` in `Scenario`.\n\n5. **Scenario includes failure types**  \n   - **Covered**: `occurrence :>> failures :> situations;` in `Scenario`.\n\n6. **Concept: Cause**  \n   - **Covered**: `abstract occurrence def Cause { ... }`\n\n7. **Cause has probability of occurrence**  \n   - **Covered**: `attribute probability : Real;` in `Cause`.\n\n8. **Concept: Failure**  \n   - **Covered**: `abstract occurrence def Failure { ... }`\n\n9. **Failure has severity level**  \n   - **Covered**: `attribute severity : Level;` in `Failure`.\n\n10. **Causal relationships between scenarios**  \n    - **Covered**: `abstract connection def Causation :> Occurrences::HappensBefore { end cause : Situation[*]; end effect : Situation[*]; }` and `abstract connection causations : Causation[*] nonunique;`\n\n11. **Combine interrelated scenarios, causes, and failures to form risk scenarios**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: The model allows for scenarios to be composed of causes and failures, but there is no explicit \"risk scenario\" composition element. However, the `Scenario` item aggregates causes and failures, which is a reasonable mapping.\n\n12. **System metadata compatible with standard modeling languages**  \n    - **Covered**: The presence of `metadata def ... :> SemanticMetadata` for all main elements shows support for semantic metadata and integration.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Covered: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 (10 claims)\n- Not covered: 3 (description attribute)\n- Partially covered: 11 (composition of risk scenario; but the aggregation in `Scenario` is a reasonable mapping, so we can count it as covered for recall purposes)\n\nSo, if we count partial coverage as covered (since the model supports the composition via aggregation), the total covered is 11 out of 12.\n\n---\n\n**Score: 11/12**"
