Summarize the results\n\n#### **Count of Supported Claims**\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- Imports: 1 (ScalarValues::Real)\n- Part Definitions: 3 (VehicleA.mass, Road.angle, Road.surfaceFriction)\n- Values: 7 (t0, t1, tn, m, theta0, theta1, thetan, sf0, sf1, sfn) [But only t0, t1, tn, m, theta0, theta1, thetan, sf0, sf1, sfn are supported, so 10]\n- Snapshots: For each snapshot, supported claims are:\n    - t = t0/t1/tn: 3\n    - mass = m: 3\n    - vehicleStates.on/off: 3\n    - angle = theta0/theta1: 3\n    - surfaceFriction = sf0/sf1/sfn: 3\n\nBut let's be careful not to double-count. For each snapshot, the claims are repeated, but each is an atomic claim.\n\nLet's enumerate:\n\n- t = t0: 1\n- mass = m: 1\n- vehicleStates.on: 1\n- angle = theta0: 1\n- surfaceFriction = sf0: 1\n\n- t = t1: 1\n- mass = m: 1\n- vehicleStates.on: 1\n- angle = theta1: 1\n- surfaceFriction = sf1: 1\n\n- t = tn: 1\n- mass = m: 1\n- vehicleStates.off: 1\n- angle = theta1: 1\n- surfaceFriction = sfn: 1\n\nSo, for the three snapshots, that's 5 claims each, 15 claims.\n\nBut some of these (e.g., mass = m) are repeated, but since each is an atomic claim in a different context, we count them.\n\nNow, let's sum up:\n\n- Imports: 1\n- Part Definitions: 3\n- Values: 10\n- Snapshots: 15\n\nTotal supported claims: 1 + 3 + 10 + 15 = **29**\n\n#### **Total Number of Claims**\n\nNow, let's count the total number of atomic claims listed above:\n\n- Imports: 3 (excluding package name)\n- Part Definitions: 2 (Temporal-Spatial Reference) + 1 (VehicleRoadContext) + 5 (VehicleA) + 2 (Road) = 10\n- Individual Definitions: 4\n- Values: 19\n- Snapshots: For each of 3 snapshots:\n    - t = tX: 1\n    - vehicle: mass, position, velocity, acceleration, vehicleStates: 5\n    - road: angle, surfaceFriction: 2\n    So, per snapshot: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8\n    For 3 snapshots: 8 x 3 = 24\n\nTotal claims: 3 (imports) + 10 (part defs) + 4 (individuals) + 19 (values) + 24 (snapshots) = **60**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score**\n\n**Score: 29/60**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Claim Category         | Supported | Total |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-------|\n| Imports               | 1         | 3     |\n| Part Definitions      | 3         | 10    |\n| Individual Definitions| 0         | 4     |\n| Values                | 10        | 19    |\n| Snapshots             | 15        | 24    |\n| **Total**             | **29**    | **60**|\n\n---\n\n## **Final Output**\n\n**Score: 29/60**",

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n### 1. Part `weighingEquipment` of type `WeighingEquipment`\n- **Generated model:** There is a `Scale` part, which is used for measurement, and a `WeighingEquipment` is not named, but `Scale` is equivalent.\n- **Covered:** Yes (by `Scale`)\n\n### 2. Part `testOperator` of type `TestOperator`\n- **Generated model:** There is a `TestOperator` part.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n### 3. Interface `Vehicle`\n- **Generated model:** There is a `Vehicle` part definition.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n### 4. `Vehicle` has attribute `actualMass: Mass`\n- **Generated model:** `Vehicle` has attribute `mass :> ISQ::mass`\n- **Covered:** Yes (naming difference, but semantically equivalent)\n\n### 5. `Vehicle` has operation `getActualMass(): Mass`\n- **Generated model:** No operation on `Vehicle` is defined.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n### 6. Attribute `maximumPermissibleMass: Mass = 2500 kg`\n- **Generated model:** `vehicleMassRequirement` sets `massReqd = 2500 [SI::kg]`\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n### 7. Action `measureVehicleMass(vehicle: Vehicle): measuredMass: Mass`\n- **Generated model:** `collectData` action in `vehicleMassTest` collects `massMeasured` from `testVehicle.mass`\n- **Covered:** Yes (functionally equivalent)\n\n### 8. Action `compareMass(measuredMass: Mass): isCompliant: Boolean`\n- **Generated model:** `MassRequirement` has constraint `massActual <= massReqd`, and `evaluateData` produces a verdict based on this.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n### 9. Action `processVehicle(vehicle: Vehicle): complianceResult: ComplianceResult`\n- **Generated model:** The sequence of actions in `vehicleMassTest` (collectData, processData, evaluateData) together process a vehicle and produce a verdict, but not a `ComplianceResult` object.\n- **Covered:** **Partial** (process is present, but no explicit `ComplianceResult` object; verdict is produced instead)\n- **Decision:** **No** (since the output type is not matched)\n\n### 10. Action `processMultipleVehicles(vehicles: Vehicle[]): results: ComplianceResult[]`\n- **Generated model:** There is a `testSystem` with two timeslices, each testing a vehicle, but no explicit action for processing multiple vehicles in a loop and collecting results.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n### 11. Requirement `MassCompliance` (verify actual mass <= 2500kg, verified by processVehicle)\n- **Generated model:** `MassRequirement` and `vehicleMassRequirement` encode this, and are verified by `vehicleMassTest`.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n### 12. Requirement `SequentialTesting` (support sequential testing and result determination for multiple vehicles)\n- **Generated model:** `testSystem` has two timeslices, each for a vehicle, showing sequential testing.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n### 13. Requirement `AutomatedComplianceManagement`\n- **Generated model:** The system automates the process, but the requirement is not explicitly stated.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n### 14. Type `Mass` with `unit: String`, `value: Real`\n- **Generated model:** Uses `ISQ::mass` (presumably a standard mass type with unit and value), but not explicitly defined.\n- **Covered:** **Partial** (uses external type, but not defined in the model)\n- **Decision:** **No** (since the type definition is not present)\n\n### 15. Type `ComplianceResult` with `vehicle: Vehicle`, `measuredMass: Mass`, `isCompliant: Boolean`\n- **Generated model:** No such type is defined; verdict is produced instead.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n### 16. Block `WeighingEquipment` with operation `measure(vehicle: Vehicle): Mass`\n- **Generated model:** `Scale` is used to measure mass, but no operation is defined; measurement is direct from `vehicle.mass`.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n### 17. Block `TestOperator` with operation `operate(equipment: WeighingEquipment, vehicle: Vehicle): Mass`\n- **Generated model:** `TestOperator` part exists, but no operation is defined.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n---\n\n## 3.

In this case, the generated model does not have explicit interfaces or ports as in the reference, but the port structure is similar. Let's be generous and count the port structure (claims 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) as covered, since the FuelOutPort encapsulates the fuel in/out and temperature.\n    - For connection (claim 16), since there is no fuelConsumingUnit, it's not covered.\n- **Not covered:** The rest.\n\nSo, covered claims:\n- 2 (vehicle : Vehicle)\n- 5 (fuelTank in FuelTankAssembly)\n- 6 (fuelPump in FuelTankAssembly)\n- 10 (FuelFlow interface, via FuelOutPort)\n- 11 (DataFlow interface, via FuelOutPort)\n- 12 (fuelOut port, via FuelOutPort)\n- 13 (fuelIn port, via FuelOutPort)\n- 14 (returnFuel port, via FuelOutPort)\n- 15 (tempData port, via FuelOutPort)\n\nTotal covered: **9**\n\nTotal claims: **26**\n\n---\n\n**Score: 9/26**"

There is an attribute definition: Diameter, which is a subtype of ISQ::LengthValue.\n15. There is an enum definition: DiameterChoice, which is a subtype of Diameter, with values:\n    - small = 60 [SI::mm]\n    - medium = 70 [SI::mm]\n    - large = 80 [SI::mm]\n16. There is an attribute: aperatureDiameter of type DiameterChoice, default value DiameterChoice::small.\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.**\n\n1. **Package name 'CoreDataTypes'**  \n   - Not supported (reference model uses 'DataTypeManagementSystem', but per instructions, ignore naming differences if structure/semantics match. So, supported.)\n2. **Private import of ScalarValues::Integer**  \n   - Not explicitly present, but the reference model defines UnsignedInteger as a type. The import is an implementation detail, not a modeling claim. Ignore.\n3. **Private import of ScalarValues::Natural**  \n   - Not explicitly present, but UnsignedInteger is defined as a type with a non-negative constraint. The use of Natural is equivalent. Supported.\n4. **Attribute definition: UnsignedInteger :> Natural**  \n   - Supported (reference model defines UnsignedInteger as a type with non-negative constraint).\n5. **Private import of ScalarValues::Real**  \n   - Not explicitly present, but UnsignedFloat is defined. The import is an implementation detail. Ignore.\n6. **Attribute definition: UnsignedReal :> Real**  \n   - Reference model defines UnsignedFloat, not UnsignedReal. If we treat 'UnsignedReal' as equivalent to 'UnsignedFloat', then supported.\n7. **UnsignedReal has attribute x: Real, with constraint x >= 0.0**  \n   - Reference model defines UnsignedFloat with constraint self >= 0.0. The use of an attribute 'x' is an implementation detail, but the constraint is equivalent. Supported.\n8. **Private import of ScalarValues::String**  \n   - Reference model defines type String. Supported.\n9. **Private import of ScalarValues::Boolean**  \n   - Reference model defines type Boolean. Supported.\n10. **Private import of Time::DateTime**  \n    - Reference model defines type DateTime. Supported.\n11. **Enum ConditionColor { red, yellow, green }**  \n    - Reference model defines enum StatusColor { red, yellow, green }. Naming is different, but structure and semantics match. Supported.\n12. **Attribute definition: ConditionLevel, with attribute associatedColor: ConditionColor**  \n    - Reference model has StatusLevel and StatusColor, and a mapping StatusToColor. The explicit attribute is not present, but the mapping is equivalent. Supported.\n13. **Enum SeverityEnum :> ConditionLevel, with values: danger (red), warning (yellow), normal (green)**  \n    - Reference model has enum StatusLevel { critical, warning, normal } and mapping to StatusColor. 'danger' vs 'critical' is a naming difference. Supported.\n14. **Attribute definition: Diameter :> ISQ::LengthValue**  \n    - Reference model defines value_type Diameter with base UnsignedFloat and unit millimeter. ISQ::LengthValue is a more general type, but the intent is the same. Supported.\n15. **Enum DiameterChoice :> Diameter, with values: small=60[mm], medium=70[mm], large=80[mm]**  \n    - Reference model has enum DiameterOption { Small, Medium, Large } and mapping DiameterOptionToValue. The generated model combines the enum and mapping into one. Supported.\n16. **Attribute: aperatureDiameter: DiameterChoice = DiameterChoice::small**  \n    - Reference model has attribute diameterOption: DiameterOption = DiameterOption::Small. Supported.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n- Claims 2 and 5 are imports and not atomic modeling claims per se, so we ignore them.\n- All other claims (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) are supported by the reference model, considering naming and minor structural differences as equivalent.\n\n**Total number of atomic claims (excluding imports): 14**  \n**Number of supported claims: 14**\n\n**Score: 14/14**",

The constraint is implicit in the enum.\n11. **Mapping DiameterOptionToValue**  \n    - **Covered**: `DiameterChoice` maps small/medium/large to 60/70/80 mm.\n\n**System Data Model**\n12. **Definition of part SystemDataModel**  \n    - **Not covered**: No explicit part or class for `SystemDataModel`.\n13. **Attribute unsignedIntValue: UnsignedInteger**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n14. **Attribute unsignedFloatValue: UnsignedFloat**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n15. **Attribute dateTimeValue: DateTime**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n16. **Attribute stringValue: String**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n17. **Attribute booleanValue: Boolean**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n18. **Attribute statusLevel: StatusLevel**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n19. **Attribute statusColor: StatusColor = StatusToColor(statusLevel)**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n20. **Attribute diameterOption: DiameterOption = DiameterOption::Small**  \n    - **Partially covered**: `aperatureDiameter: DiameterChoice = DiameterChoice::small;` (but not in a system data model part).\n21. **Attribute diameter: Diameter = DiameterOptionToValue(diameterOption)**  \n    - **Not covered**: No such attribute.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Satisfies `DynamicRegulation` — **Not covered**\n32. Satisfies `Safety` — **Not covered**\n33. Satisfies `Comfort` — **Not covered**\n34. Satisfies `OptimalOperation` — **Not covered**\n\n**Are any claims covered?**\n\nLet's check if any claims are actually covered, even partially, in a way that counts as \"covered\" per the instructions (structure and semantics match, not just similar names):\n\n- The generated model does have actions for monitoring brake pedal and traction, and for braking, with flows connecting them. This matches the *behavior* of monitoring inputs and adjusting outputs, though not the exact structure.\n\nSo, let's reconsider claims 27 (transition for monitoring and adjusting):  \n- The generated model has a sequence: monitorBrakePedal → monitorTraction → braking, with flows from outputs of monitoring actions to inputs of braking. This is semantically equivalent to \"monitor and adjust brake pressure and modulation frequency based on brake pedal input and traction variations.\"  \n- Therefore, **claim 27 is covered**.\n\nSimilarly, the generated model has:\n- An action `Braking` that takes `brakePressure` and `modulationFrequency` as inputs, which matches the adjustment of brake pressure and modulation frequency.\n\nSo, for claims 22 and 23 (outputs of behavior), the generated model produces `brakePressure` and `modulationFrequency` as outputs of actions, which is semantically equivalent.  \n- **Claims 22 and 23 are covered.**\n\nFor claims 20 and 21 (inputs to behavior), the generated model monitors brake pedal and traction, which is semantically equivalent to using those as inputs.  \n- **Claims 20 and 21 are covered.**\n\nFor claim 18 (behavior definition), the generated model defines a composite action `Brake` with sub-actions, which is equivalent to a behavior.  \n- **Claim 18 is covered.**\n\nFor claim 19 (input `ignitionKeyTurnedToStart`), the generated model has an attribute `TurnKeyToOn` and an action `TurnOn` at the start of the `Brake` action. This is semantically equivalent.  \n- **Claim 19 is covered.**\n\nFor claim 9 (output signal `brakePressureCommand`), the generated model has an output `brakePressure` from `MonitorBrakePedal` and as input to `Braking`. This is semantically equivalent.  \n- **Claim 9 is covered.**\n\nFor claim 10 (output signal `modulationFrequencyCommand`), the generated model has an output `modulationFrequency` from `MonitorTraction` and as input to `Braking`. This is semantically equivalent.  \n- **Claim 10 is covered.**\n\nFor claim 7 (input signal `brakePedalStatus`), the generated model monitors the brake pedal, which is semantically equivalent.  \n- **Claim 7 is covered.**\n\nFor claim 8 (input signal `tractionData`), the generated model monitors traction, which is semantically equivalent.  \n- **Claim 8 is covered.**\n\nFor claim 6 (input signal `ignitionKeyTurnedToStart`), the generated model has `TurnKeyToOn` and `TurnOn` action, which is semantically equivalent.  \n- **Claim 6 is covered.**\n\nFor claim 27 (transition for monitoring and adjusting), as above, the generated model covers this.\n\n**So, let's update the coverage:**\n\n**Covered claims:**\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27\n\n**Total covered: 12**\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n**Score: 12/34**"

Power inputs: whlpwr (wheelEndPower), Cd (aeroDragCoeff), Cf (rollingResistCoeff), tm (totalMass), v (speed).

This is a simplification, not equivalent. **(Not supported)**\n7. friction = Cf * tm * v: Reference uses rollingResistance = rollingResistCoeff * totalMass * 9.81. This is a simplification, not equivalent. **(Not supported)**\n8. PowerValue = whlpwr - drag - friction: Reference uses drivingPower = input.wheelEndPower; acceleration = (drivingPower / speed - totalResistance) / input.totalMass.
