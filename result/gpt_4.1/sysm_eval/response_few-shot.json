Part instance vehicle — SUPPORTED (reference has 'vehicle' part).\n8. vehicle.mass = sum(subparts' mass) — SUPPORTED (reference has 'aggregateMass' action that sums subparts' quality data to produce mass).\n9. vehicle contains part engine — SUPPORTED.\n10. engine has mass: MassValue — PARTIALLY SUPPORTED (reference has 'engine' part, but with 'qualityDataPort', not 'mass' attribute).\n11. vehicle contains part transmission — SUPPORTED.\n12. transmission has mass: MassValue — PARTIALLY SUPPORTED (same as above).\n13. vehicle contains part frontAxleAssembly — SUPPORTED.\n14. frontAxleAssembly has mass: MassValue — PARTIALLY SUPPORTED (same as above).\n15. vehicle contains part rearAxleAssembly — SUPPORTED.\n16. rearAxleAssembly has mass: MassValue — PARTIALLY SUPPORTED (same as above).\n\n**C.

The reference model is a specific system model for a blood glucose meter, with attributes, ports, parts, actions, and requirements, but **does not define a general FMEA framework**.\n\n#### High-level analysis:\n- The generated model is a generic FMEA framework, with a user model that instantiates a glucose meter FMEA.\n- The reference model is a system model for a blood glucose meter, with requirements, parts, actions, and flows, but **does not use FMEA concepts** (no explicit \"Cause\", \"FailureMode\", \"Effect\", \"FMEAItem\", etc.).\n- The only overlap is at the level of **domain concepts**: battery depletion, battery cannot be charged, glucose level undetected, therapy delay, requirements for battery status detection, alarm, risk management, etc.\n\n##### Let's check the claims:\n\n**Framework claims (1-72):**  \nAll claims about the FMEA framework (types, attributes, connections, metadata, etc.) are **not present** in the reference model. The reference model does not define or use these types or structures.\n\n**User model claims (73-102):**  \n- Requirements req1, req2, req3: The reference model defines requirements, but not with these names or structure. However, the *content* of the requirements (e.g., battery status detection, alarm, risk management) is present in the reference model's requirements. But the *modeling claim* is about the existence of these requirement elements, which are not present in the reference model.\n- RequirementWithSIL, StatusHolder, SIL: Not present in the reference model.\n- FMEA items, causes, failure modes, effects, causations, preventions, mitigations, violations: Not present in the reference model.\n- The *domain events* (battery depleted, battery cannot be charged, glucose level undetected, therapy delay) are present as concepts in the reference model's requirements and actions, but not as explicit events or occurrences.\n- The *structure* of the user model (parts: glucose meter, battery, pump, reservoir, patient) matches the reference model's parts (bloodGlucoseMeter, user), but the reference model does not have explicit subparts for battery, pump, reservoir, or patient as a part of the glucose meter.\n- The *events* (e.g., 'battery depleted'[*]) are not present as events in the reference model.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The only possible matches are at the *domain concept* level (battery, glucose meter, patient, therapy delay, etc.), but the *modeling claims* (as explicit parts, events, FMEA items, etc.) are not present in the reference model.\n\n**Therefore, none of the atomic claims in the generated model are supported by the reference model.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 0/102**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n---\n\n**Score: 0/102**",

The package 'AutomotiveComponents' is defined.  \n   - **Not supported** (Reference model uses 'AutomotiveComponentModel', but package name differences are ignored if structure matches. However, the rest of the structure is not nested under this package, so let's consider this as supported.)\n\n2. The package imports SI::*.\n   - **Not supported** (Reference model does not use explicit import statements, but uses 'si::' and 'imperial::' prefixes. Let's consider this as a naming/formatting difference and mark as supported.)\n\n3. The package imports USCustomaryUnits::*.\n   - **Not supported** (Reference model uses 'imperial::', which is equivalent to USCustomaryUnits. Supported.)\n\n4. Part definition: Vehicle_1.\n   - **Supported** (Reference model defines 'Vehicle' part; naming difference is ignored.)\n\n5. Vehicle_1 has attribute mass of type MassValue, default value 1200 [kg].\n   - **Supported** (Reference: attribute mass: Mass = 1200.0 * kilogram; Type name is different, but both refer to mass with units.)\n\n6. Vehicle_1 has attribute length of type LengthValue, default value 4.82 [m].\n   - **Supported** (Reference: attribute length: Length = 4.82 * meter;)\n\n7. Vehicle_1 has part leftFrontWheel of type Wheel.\n   - **Supported** (Reference: part frontLeftWheel: Wheel;)\n\n8. Vehicle_1 has part rightFrontWheel of type Wheel.\n   - **Supported** (Reference: part frontRightWheel: Wheel;)\n\n9. Part definition: Wheel.\n   - **Supported** (Reference: part def Wheel.)\n\n10. Wheel has attribute hubDiameter of type LengthValue, default value 18 ['in'].\n    - **Supported** (Reference: attribute hubDiameter: Diameter; context assigns hubDiameter = inchToMeter(18.0 * inch); The generated model uses a different type and unit, but the structure and semantics match.)\n\n11. Wheel has attribute width of type LengthValue, default value 245 [mm].\n    - **Supported** (Reference: attribute width: Width; context assigns width = mmToMeter(245.0 * millimeter); Again, type and unit differences, but structure and semantics match.)\n\n12. Wheel has attribute outerDiameter of type LengthValue, defined as (hubDiameter + 2 * tire.height) [mm].\n    - **Supported** (Reference: attribute outerDiameter: Diameter; constraint: outerDiameter = hubDiameter + 2.0 * tire.tireHeight; The generated model uses 'tire.height' instead of 'tire.tireHeight', but this is a naming difference.)\n\n13. Wheel has part tire of type Tire[1].\n    - **Supported** (Reference: part tire: Tire;)\n\n14.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model\n\n#### General mapping:\n- The reference model uses custom types (`TimeUTC`, `CartesianPosition`, `CartesianVelocity`, `TrajectorySample`) and a part structure.\n- The generated model uses more generic, possibly library-based types (`TimeScale`, `CartesianSpatial3dCoordinateFrame`, etc.), and a more abstract, function-based structure.\n- The core concept in both is: sampling a trajectory during ascent, with samples containing time, position, and velocity.\n\n#### Now, let's check each claim:\n\n| # |

For partial semantic overlap (e.g., action vs. event occurrence), if the intent and role in the system are equivalent, we can count as supported.\n\nSo, let's count as supported those with clear semantic equivalence, even if the modeling construct differs (e.g., action vs. event occurrence).\n\n**Supported claims:**\n- 5, 8, 11 (Subscribe, Publish, Deliver as message types, even if named differently)\n- 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 (parts and their events/actions)\n- 23, 24, 25 (messages/flows)\n\nThat is: 5, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (**15 claims**)\n\n**Total claims:** 25\n\n---\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nScore: 15/25",

Not supported (different package, but this is a naming difference and can be ignored if structure matches).\n2. **Import 'ScalarValues::*'**: Not present in the reference model. Not supported.\n3. **Import 'PayloadDefinitions::*'**: Not present in the reference model. Not supported.\n\n**B. PayloadDefinitions Subpackage**\n4. **Subpackage 'PayloadDefinitions'**: The reference model does not use subpackages, but defines message types (Topic, Message, etc.) at the top level. Not directly supported, but the intent (defining payload types) is present.\n5. **Item 'Subscribe'**: The reference model has 'SubscriptionRequest' and 'SubscriptionAck', but not a 'Subscribe' item. Not directly supported.\n6. **'Subscribe' has attribute 'topic: String'**: The reference model's 'SubscriptionRequest' does not specify attributes, but the concept of a topic is present. Partially supported.\n7. **'Subscribe' has ref part 'subscriber'**: The reference model has a 'consumer' part, but not as a reference in the message. Not supported.\n8. **Item 'Publish'**: The reference model has 'Topic' and 'Message' as separate attributes, not a 'Publish' item. Not directly supported.\n9. **'Publish' has attribute 'topic: String'**: The reference model has 'topic' as an attribute in 'PublishPort' and in actions. Supported.\n10. **'Publish' has ref 'publication'**: No such reference in the reference model. Not supported.\n11. **Item 'Deliver'**: The reference model has delivery actions and ports, but not a 'Deliver' item. Not directly supported.\n12. **'Deliver' has ref 'publication'**: No such reference in the reference model. Not supported.\n\n**C. Occurrence Definition**\n13. **Occurrence 'PubSubSequence'**: The reference model does not use 'occurrence', but models the sequence of actions and flows. Partially supported (sequence is modeled, but not as an 'occurrence').\n14. **Part 'producer[1]'**: The reference model has a 'producer' part. Supported.\n15. **'producer' has event 'publish_message.source'**: The reference model has a 'publishMessage' action in 'producer', which is the source of a publish flow. Supported.\n16. **Message 'publish_message' of 'Publish[1]'**: The reference model has a publish flow with topic and message, but not as a single 'Publish' message. Partially supported.\n17. **Part 'server[1]'**: The reference model has a 'server' part. Supported.\n18. **'server' has event 'subscribe_message.target'**: The reference model has 'acceptSubscription' action in 'server', which is the target of a subscription flow. Supported.\n19. **'server' then has event 'publish_message.target'**: The reference model has 'acceptPublish' action in 'server', which is the target of a publish flow. Supported.\n20. **'server' then has event 'deliver_message.source'**: The reference model has 'deliverMessage' action in 'server', which is the source of a delivery flow. Supported.\n21. **Message 'subscribe_message' of 'Subscribe[1]'**: The reference model has a subscription flow, but not as a 'Subscribe' message. Partially supported.\n22. **Message 'deliver_message' of 'Deliver[1]'**: The reference model has a delivery flow, but not as a 'Deliver' message. Partially supported.\n23. **Part 'consumer[1]'**: The reference model has a 'consumer' part. Supported.\n24. **'consumer' has event 'subscribe_message.source'**: The reference model has 'sendSubscriptionRequest' action in 'consumer', which is the source of a subscription flow. Supported.\n25. **'consumer' then has event 'deliver_message.target'**: The reference model has 'receiveMessage' action in 'consumer', which is the target of a delivery flow. Supported.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- Claims 1: Supported (package naming can be ignored if structure matches)\n- Claims 2, 3: Not supported (imports not present)\n- Claim 4: Supported (subpackage structure can be ignored if types are present)\n- Claim 5: Not supported (no 'Subscribe' item, but similar concept exists)\n- Claim 6: Partially supported (topic attribute is present in flows)\n- Claim 7: Not supported\n- Claim 8: Not supported (no 'Publish' item, but similar concept exists)\n- Claim 9: Supported (topic attribute is present)\n- Claim 10: Not supported\n- Claim 11: Not supported\n- Claim 12: Not supported\n- Claim 13: Partially supported (sequence is modeled, but not as 'occurrence')\n- Claim 14: Supported\n- Claim 15: Supported\n- Claim 16: Partially supported\n- Claim 17: Supported\n- Claim 18: Supported\n- Claim 19: Supported\n- Claim 20: Supported\n- Claim 21: Partially supported\n- Claim 22: Partially supported\n- Claim 23: Supported\n- Claim 24: Supported\n- Claim 25: Supported\n\nLet's count only the fully supported claims (ignoring partials and not supported):\n\n- 1 (package)\n- 4 (subpackage, if we ignore structure)\n- 9 (topic attribute in Publish)\n- 14 (producer part)\n- 15 (producer event)\n- 17 (server part)\n- 18 (server event)\n- 19 (server event)\n- 20 (server event)\n- 23 (consumer part)\n- 24 (consumer event)\n- 25 (consumer event)\n\nThat's 12 fully supported claims.\n\nIf we include partials (claims where the concept is present but not the exact structure), we can add:\n- 6 (topic attribute in Subscribe)\n- 13 (occurrence/sequence)\n- 16 (publish_message as a message)\n- 21 (subscribe_message as a message)\n- 22 (deliver_message as a message)\n\nThat's 5 more, for a total of 17.\n\n**Total number of claims:** 25\n\n**Score (strict, only fully supported):** 12/25  \n**Score (including partial matches):** 17/25\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nScore: 12/25\n\n*(If partial matches are accepted: Score: 17/25)*",

Succession/Flow Definitions**\n42-47. All flows – Not present\n\n**However, let's check for any possible semantic overlap:**\n\n- The generated model defines a part \"Vehicle\" and a state machine \"VehicleStates\" with states \"off\", \"starting\", \"on\", and transitions triggered by signals.\n- The signals \"VehicleStartSignal\", \"VehicleOnSignal\", \"VehicleOffSignal\" are used to trigger state transitions.\n- There is an action \"performSelfTest\" in the \"on\" state, and actions \"providePower\" and \"applyParkingBrake\".\n\nAre any of these equivalent to the reference model's atomic claims?\n\n- The state machine in the generated model is a high-level abstraction of the power management process, but it does not define the same structure (attributes, ports, parts, actions, flows) as the reference model.\n- The \"performSelfTest\" action could be loosely related to \"performSelfDiagnosis\", but the reference model's action is more specific (input/output types), and the generated model's action only takes a \"vehicle\" as input.\n- The signals in the generated model are not mapped to the reference model's attributes or ports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is no direct or equivalent coverage of any atomic claim from the reference model in the generated model. The generated model is a different abstraction, focusing on a state machine for a vehicle, not the detailed port/action/flow structure of the reference.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 0/47**"

The model defines a package named 'VehicleHealthMonitoring'.**  \n**Supported** (Reference model uses the same package name.)\n\n**2. The model imports ISQ::TemperatureValue.**  \n**Not Supported** (Reference model does not mention this import or type.)\n\n**3.

The model imports SI::h.**  \n**Not Supported** (Reference model does not mention this import or type.)\n\n**6. The model defines an attribute OverTemp.**  \n**Partially Supported** (Reference model defines OverTempWarning as an attribute and as a port output. If we consider OverTemp equivalent to OverTempWarning, then **Supported**.)\n\n**7. The model defines a part Vehicle.**  \n**Supported** (Reference model defines a part vehicle.)\n\n**8. The Vehicle part has an attribute maintenanceTime of type TimeInstantValue.**  \n**Partially Supported** (Reference model has MaintenanceElapsedTime and MaintenanceInterval, but not maintenanceTime.

The Vehicle part has an attribute maintenanceInterval of type DurationValue.**  \n**Supported** (Reference model has attribute MaintenanceInterval.)\n\n**10. The Vehicle part has an attribute maxTemperature of type TemperatureValue.**  \n**Supported** (Reference model has attribute MaxAllowableTemperature, which is used as maxTemperature.)\n\n**11. The model defines a part VehicleController.**  \n**Not Supported** (Reference model does not define a VehicleController part.)\n\n**12. The model defines an action senseTemperature with an output temp of type TemperatureValue.**  \n**Partially Supported** (Reference model has a TempSensePort with output temperature: Temperature, and an action monitorVehicleHealth with input temperature.

ControllerStartSignal (attribute)\n- 34. controller (VehicleController part)\n\nIf we are generous and count partial matches (e.g., VehicleStartSignal for StartSignal, VehicleOffSignal for StopSignal, VehicleOnSignal for PowerOnSignal, brakePedalDepressed for BrakePedalStatus, Vehicle for vehicleSystem), we could count more, but the instructions say \"the same or equivalent element,\" not just a similar name.\n\nSo, let's count the following as covered:\n- 1. StartSignal (VehicleStartSignal)\n- 2. StopSignal (VehicleOffSignal)\n- 3. PowerOnSignal (VehicleOnSignal)\n- 4. BrakePedalStatus (brakePedalDepressed in Vehicle)\n- 5. ControllerStartSignal (ControllerStartSignal)\n- 24. vehicleSystem (Vehicle)\n- 34. controller (VehicleController)\n\nThat's 7 claims.\n\nBut, for the rest (ports, actions, flows, other attributes), there is no equivalent.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 7/58**"

Attribute definition: `Mass`\n- **Covered.** The generated model defines `mass :> ISQ::mass` for `Vehicle`.\n\n#### 3. Attribute definition: `MassStatus` (with values `{Qualified, Unqualified}`)\n- **Partially covered.** The generated model uses `verdict : VerdictKind` (likely Pass/Fail), which is semantically similar, but not explicitly named `MassStatus` or with the same values. We'll count this as **covered** due to semantic equivalence.\n\n#### 4. Constant definition: `MASS_LIMIT: Mass = 2500`\n- **Covered.** The requirement explicitly states `massActual <= 2500[SI::kg]`.\n\n#### 5. Port definition: `VehiclePort` with output `vehicleId: VehicleId`\n- **Not covered.** No explicit port or interface for `VehicleId` in the generated model.\n\n#### 6.

Port definition: `MassStatusPort` with output `massStatus: MassStatus`\n- **Not covered.** No explicit port structure.\n\n#### 8. Part definition: `context`\n- **Partially covered.** The generated model has a system structure, but not a named `context` part. We'll count this as **not covered**.\n\n#### 9.

Perform on `weighingEquipment`: `massVerification.measureMass` with input assignment `vehicleId = vehiclePort.vehicleId` and output assignment `mass = massPort.mass`\n- **Covered.** The `collectData` action in the generated model measures mass from the vehicle.\n\n#### 16. Part definition: `massVerificationUnit` inside `context`\n- **Covered.** The generated model has a `MassVerificationSystem` part, which is semantically equivalent.\n\n#### 17. Port on `massVerificationUnit`: `massPort: ~MassPort`\n- **Not covered.** No explicit port.\n\n#### 18.

Action definition: `massVerification`\n- **Covered.** The generated model has a `VehicleMassTest` verification definition, which is semantically equivalent.\n\n#### 21. Sub-action: `sendVehicleId` with output `vehicleId: VehicleId`\n- **Not covered.** No explicit action for sending vehicle ID.\n\n#### 22. Succession/flow: `vehicleIdFlow` from `sendVehicleId.vehicleId` to `measureMass.vehicleId`\n- **Not covered.** No explicit flow for vehicle ID.\n\n#### 23. Sub-action: `measureMass` with input `vehicleId: VehicleId` and output `mass: Mass`\n- **Partially covered.** The generated model's `collectData` action measures mass, but does not explicitly take a vehicle ID as input. We'll count this as **covered** due to the context.\n\n#### 24. Succession/flow: `massFlow` from `measureMass.mass` to `verifyMass.mass`\n- **Covered.** The generated model passes mass from `collectData` to `processData` to `evaluateData`.\n\n#### 25. Sub-action: `verifyMass` with input `mass: Mass` and output `massStatus: MassStatus`\n- **Covered.** The `evaluateData` action does this.\n\n#### 26.

However, the names and types differ, and the reference model's action is part of a larger action structure. For recall, unless the mapping is clear, this is **Not covered**.\n24. integrateWithModelCenter action — **Not covered**\n25. provideOutputs action — **Not covered**\n\n### Succession/Flow Definitions\n26. inputFlow succession — **Not covered**\n27. outputFlow succession — **Not covered**\n\n#### Additional consideration:\nThe generated model defines an action `computeDynamics` with:\n- in dt : ISQ::TimeValue\n- in a : ISQ::AccelerationValue\n- in v_in : ISQ::SpeedValue\n- in x_in : ISQ::LengthValue\n- out v_out : ISQ::SpeedValue\n- out x_out : ISQ::LengthValue\n\nThis action is similar in intent to the reference model's `runSimulation` or `integrateWithModelCenter`, but the reference model's structure is much richer, with ports, parts, interfaces, and more actions.\n\nFor recall, we only count a claim as covered if the generated model contains the same or equivalent element. The generated model only contains a single action with inputs and outputs, and none of the structural, port, or attribute definitions.\n\n**So, the only possible matches are:**\n- The action `computeDynamics` is similar to `runSimulation` or `integrateWithModelCenter`, but not named the same, and the types are different. For recall, unless the mapping is clear, we do not count this as covered.\n\n**Therefore, none of the atomic claims in the reference model are covered by the generated model.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 0/27**"

This is a high-level mapping to the reference model's risk analysis, but the atomic claims (attributes, ports, actions, flows) are not explicitly present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Claim 16 (context.equipment.battery) is **partially** covered by Device.battery.\n- Claim 3 (SeverityLevel) is **partially** covered by Level/LevelEnum.\n- Claim 17 (context.riskAnalysisSystem) is **not covered**.\n- Claim 33-39 (actions) are **not covered** as such, but the scenario in the generated model does have a cause, situation, and failure, which is a high-level mapping.\n\nHowever, per the instructions, only atomic claims that are the same or equivalent are to be counted as covered.
