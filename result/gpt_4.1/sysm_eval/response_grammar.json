For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a part named `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered.** `part def Vehicle` exists in the generated model.\n\n#### 2. `Vehicle` has an attribute `actualMass` of type `Real`.\n- **Partially Covered.** The generated model has `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass;` in `Vehicle`. This is semantically equivalent to `actualMass: Real` (with a more specific type). The name differs, but the meaning is the same.\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has an attribute `isCompliant` of type `Boolean`.\n- **Not Covered.** There is no attribute in `Vehicle` for compliance status in the generated model.\n\n#### 4. There is a part named `WeighingEquipment`.\n- **Covered.** `part def Scale;` is present, which is equivalent to `WeighingEquipment`.\n\n#### 5. `WeighingEquipment` has an operation `measureMass(vehicle: Vehicle): Real`.\n- **Partially Covered.** The generated model's `Scale` is used in the `collectData` action to measure the vehicle's mass, which is functionally equivalent to the operation, though not declared as an explicit operation.\n\n#### 6. There is a part named `TestOperator`.\n- **Covered.** `part def TestOperator;` is present.\n\n#### 7. `TestOperator` has an operation `operate(equipment: WeighingEquipment, vehicle: Vehicle): Real`.\n- **Partially Covered.** The generated model includes a `testOperator` part and actions that coordinate the test, but there is no explicit operation on `TestOperator`. The role is distributed across actions.\n\n#### 8.

The system refers to `vehicleUnderTest` and individual vehicles.\n\n#### 11. `ComplianceSystem` has a part `weighingEquipment` of type `WeighingEquipment`.\n- **Covered.** `part scale : Scale` in `massVerificationSystem` is equivalent.\n\n#### 12. `ComplianceSystem` has a part `testOperator` of type `TestOperator`.\n- **Covered.** `part testOperator : TestOperator` in `massVerificationSystem`.\n\n#### 13. `ComplianceSystem` has an operation `verifyCompliance(vehicle: Vehicle): Boolean` with the following logic:\n    - Calls `testOperator.operate(weighingEquipment, vehicle)` to get `measuredMass`.\n    - Sets `vehicle.actualMass = measuredMass`.\n    - If `measuredMass <= maxPermissibleMass`, sets `vehicle.isCompliant = true`, else `false`.\n    - Returns `vehicle.isCompliant`.\n- **Partially Covered.** The generated model's `vehicleMassTest` verification and its actions (`collectData`, `processData`, `evaluateData`) implement the same logic, but do not set an `isCompliant` attribute on the vehicle; instead, they return a verdict. The compliance check is present, but the attribute update is not.\n\n#### 14. `ComplianceSystem` has an operation `testAllVehicles(): Boolean[*]` with the following logic:\n    - For each `v` in `vehicles`, calls `verifyCompliance(v)` and collects results in a list.\n    - Returns the list of results.\n- **Partially Covered.** The generated model has test cases for multiple vehicles (via timeslices and individuals), but there is no explicit operation that iterates over a collection and returns a list of Boolean results.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Constraint in `Vehicle`: `highPerformanceEngine` — if `isHighPerformance` then engine is `SixCylinderEngine`, else engine is `FourCylinderEngine`.\n14. Constraint in `Vehicle`: `validPowertrainCombinations` — (engine is `FourCylinderEngine` and transmission is `ManualTransmission`) or (engine is `SixCylinderEngine` and transmission is `AutomaticTransmission`).\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine coverage in the generated model.**\n\n1. **Engine**: Covered (`part def Engine;`)\n2. **FourCylinderEngine specializes Engine**: Covered (`part def '4CylEngine' :> Engine;`) — naming difference, but equivalent.\n3. **SixCylinderEngine specializes Engine**: Covered (`part def '6CylEngine' :> Engine;`) — naming difference, but equivalent.\n4. **Transmission**: Covered (`part def Transmission;`)\n5. **ManualTransmission specializes Transmission**: Covered (`part def ManualTransmission :> Transmission;`)\n6. **AutomaticTransmission specializes Transmission**: Covered (`part def AutomaticTransmission :> Transmission;`)\n7. **Vehicle**: Covered (`part def Vehicle { ... }`)\n8. **isHighPerformance: Boolean**: Covered (`attribute isHighPerformance: Boolean;`)\n9. **engine: Engine**: Covered (`part engine: Engine[1];`)\n10. **transmission: Transmission**: Covered (`part transmission: Transmission[1];`)\n11. **Constraint: selectOneEngine**: **Not explicitly covered**. There is no explicit constraint that restricts `engine` to only be a `FourCylinderEngine` or `SixCylinderEngine`. The only constraints are in the context of `isHighPerformance` and the valid combinations, but not a general restriction.\n12. **Constraint: selectOneTransmission**: **Not explicitly covered**. There is no explicit constraint that restricts `transmission` to only be a `ManualTransmission` or `AutomaticTransmission`.\n13. **Constraint: highPerformanceEngine**: Covered. The constraint:\n    ```\n    if isHighPerformance? engine istype '6CylEngine'\n    else engine istype '4CylEngine'\n    ```\n    is equivalent to the reference.\n14. **Constraint: validPowertrainCombinations**: **Partially covered**. The generated model has:\n    ```\n    (engine istype '4CylEngine' and transmission istype ManualTransmission) xor\n    (engine istype '6CylEngine' and transmission istype AutomaticTransmission)\n    ```\n    The reference model uses `or`, not `xor`. The generated model's use of `xor` means that only one of the two combinations is allowed, not both. The reference allows either or both (if possible). However, since the model only allows one engine and one transmission, the difference is subtle, but the generated model is more restrictive. For recall, since the generated model enforces the combinations, albeit more strictly, we can consider this as **covered** for recall purposes.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n- Total atomic claims: 14\n- Covered claims: 12 (claims 1-10, 13, 14)\n- Not covered: 2 (claims 11 and 12)\n\n**Score: 12/14**"

Summarize the results\n\nNow, let's count the number of **fully covered** claims (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element), and the number of **partially covered** claims (structure is present but not as rich as in the reference), and the number of **not covered** claims.\n\nHowever, per instructions, only claims that are \"covered\" (i.e., the generated model contains the same or equivalent element) should be counted as covered. \"Partially covered\" is not enough unless the semantics are clearly equivalent.\n\n#### Fully covered claims:\n- 47. ProducerPublishesToServer (publish_message from producer to server)\n- 48. ConsumerSubscribesToServer (subscribe_message from consumer to server)\n- 49. ServerDeliversToConsumer (deliver_message from server to consumer)\n\n**Total fully covered claims: 3**\n\n#### Partially covered claims (not counted as covered for recall):\n- Many claims are partially covered (e.g., topic as string instead of object, blocks as parts in sequence, etc.), but per instructions, only fully covered claims count.\n\n#### Total number of claims: 51\n\n---\n\n## Final Score\n\n**Score: 3/51**"

Again, naming is different, but structure and semantics match.\n\n6. **Definition of action `TakePicture` with:**\n   - **input `scene: Scene`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow takes `user: User` as input, but the first step is to select a `Scene` from the user. The generated model skips the user and starts from the scene, which is a simplification but not a contradiction.\n   - **output `picture: Picture`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow outputs a `Photograph`, which is equivalent to `Picture`.\n   - **sub-action `focus: Focus` with input `scene` and output `image`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow has a step `focusScene: FocusScene` with input `scene` and output `image`.\n   - **sub-action `shoot: Shoot` with input `image` and output `picture`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow has a step `shootImage: ShootImage` with input `image` and output `photograph`.\n   - **binding `focus.scene = scene`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow passes the selected scene to the focus step.\n   - **flow from `focus.image` to `shoot.image`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow passes the image from the focus step to the shoot step.\n   - **ordering: first `focus` then `shoot`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow orders the steps in this way.\n   - **binding `shoot.picture = picture`**  \n     - **Supported.** The reference workflow assigns the output of the shoot step to the workflow output.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n- Total atomic claims: 6 (with subclaims for the structure of `TakePicture`; let's count each subclaim as a separate atomic claim for precision).\n- Let's enumerate the subclaims for `TakePicture` (from above, 8 subclaims).\n- So, total atomic claims: 5 (items and actions) + 8 (subclaims for `TakePicture`) = **13**.\n\nLet's list them explicitly for clarity:\n\n1.

The system defines a part `vehicle` of type `Vehicle`.\n2. The system defines a part `controller` of type `VehicleController`.\n3. The system defines a property `maxAllowableTemperature` of type `Real`.\n4. The system defines a property `maintenanceInterval` of type `Duration`.\n5. The system defines a property `maintenanceDuration` of type `Duration` with default value `48h`.\n\n#### State machine: HealthStatusStateMachine\n6. The system defines a state machine `HealthStatusStateMachine`.\n7. The state machine defines a state `Normal`.\n8. The state machine defines a state `Degraded`.\n9. The state machine defines a state `Maintenance`.\n\n##### Transitions:\n10. Transition `NormalToDegraded`: from `Normal` to `Degraded`, triggered when `vehicle.temperature > maxAllowableTemperature`, with effect `controller.sendWarning(\"OverTemperature\")`.\n11. Transition `DegradedToNormal`: from `Degraded` to `Normal`, triggered when `vehicle.temperature <= maxAllowableTemperature`.\n12. Transition `AnyToMaintenance`: from `Normal, Degraded` to `Maintenance`, triggered when `vehicle.timeSinceLastMaintenance >= maintenanceInterval`, with effect `updateNextMaintenanceTime()`.\n13. Transition `MaintenanceToNormal`: from `Maintenance` to `Normal`, triggered when `maintenanceElapsedTime() >= maintenanceDuration`.\n\n#### Operations\n14. Operation `updateNextMaintenanceTime()`, which sets `vehicle.lastMaintenanceTime = now()` and `vehicle.nextMaintenanceTime = now() + maintenanceInterval`.\n15. Operation `maintenanceElapsedTime() : Duration`, which returns `now() - vehicle.maintenanceStartTime`.\n\n#### Constraints\n16. Constraint `TemperatureMonitoring`: `vehicle.temperature` is sensed automatically.\n17. Constraint `TemperatureMonitoring`: `vehicle.temperature` is compared to `maxAllowableTemperature`.\n18.

(Naming difference, but same semantics.)\n4. **maintenanceInterval : Duration**  \n   - **Covered**: `attribute maintenanceInterval : DurationValue;` in `Vehicle`.\n5. **maintenanceDuration : Duration = 48h**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: The transition from maintenance to normal uses `after 48 [h]`, which matches the default value, but there is no explicit property for `maintenanceDuration`.  \n   - **Decision**: **Covered** (since the duration is encoded in the transition, matching the reference semantics).\n\n#### State machine: HealthStatusStateMachine\n6. **State machine HealthStatusStateMachine**  \n   - **Covered**: `state healthStates` in generated model.\n7. **State Normal**  \n   - **Covered**: `state normal;`\n8. **State Degraded**  \n   - **Covered**: `state degraded;`\n9. **State Maintenance**  \n   - **Covered**: `state maintenance { ... }`\n\n##### Transitions:\n10. **NormalToDegraded**  \n    - **Covered**: `accept when senseTemperature.temp > vehicle.maxTemperature do send OverTemp() to controller then degraded;`  \n      (The effect is a warning sent to controller; the trigger matches.)\n11. **DegradedToNormal**  \n    - **Covered**: `accept when senseTemperature.temp <= vehicle.maxTemperature then normal;`\n12. **AnyToMaintenance**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: `accept at vehicle.maintenanceTime then maintenance;`  \n      This is a time-based transition, but the reference uses `vehicle.timeSinceLastMaintenance >= maintenanceInterval`. The generated model uses a scheduled time (`maintenanceTime`).  \n      - **Decision**: **Covered** (semantics are equivalent: transition to maintenance at scheduled interval).\n13. **MaintenanceToNormal**  \n    - **Covered**: `accept after 48 [h] then normal;`  \n      (Matches the duration-based transition.)\n\n#### Operations\n14. **updateNextMaintenanceTime()**  \n    - **Covered**: In `state maintenance`, `entry assign vehicle.maintenanceTime := vehicle.maintenanceTime + vehicle.maintenanceInterval;`  \n      (Equivalent effect: updates next maintenance time.)\n15. **maintenanceElapsedTime() : Duration**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No operation or calculation for elapsed maintenance time is present.\n\n#### Constraints\n16. **vehicle.temperature is sensed automatically**  \n    - **Covered**: `do senseTemperature;` in state machine.\n17. **vehicle.temperature is compared to maxAllowableTemperature**  \n    - **Covered**: `accept when senseTemperature.temp > vehicle.maxTemperature` and `<= vehicle.maxTemperature`.\n18. **vehicle.maintenance is performed at intervals of maintenanceInterval**  \n    - **Covered**: `accept at vehicle.maintenanceTime then maintenance;` and update of `maintenanceTime`.\n\n#### Block Vehicle\n19. **temperature : Real**  \n    - **Covered**: `senseTemperature { out temp : TemperatureValue; }` and use of `senseTemperature.temp` as vehicle temperature.  \n      (Not a direct attribute, but the temperature is modeled and used.)\n20. **lastMaintenanceTime : Time**  \n    - **Not Covered**: Only `maintenanceTime` is present; no explicit `lastMaintenanceTime`.\n21. **nextMaintenanceTime : Time**  \n    - **Not Covered**: Only `maintenanceTime` is present; no explicit `nextMaintenanceTime`.\n22. **timeSinceLastMaintenance : Duration**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No such attribute.\n23. **maintenanceStartTime : Time**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No such attribute.\n\n#### Block VehicleController\n24. **sendWarning(warningType : String)**  \n    - **Covered**: `do send OverTemp() to controller` (the warning type is fixed, but the effect is present).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Attributes and Types\n55. **BumperComponent has attribute `safetyRelated: Boolean = true`.**  \n   - **Partially covered.**  \n     - `bumper` has `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`.

Views\n#### HierarchyTree\n66. **View `HierarchyTree` exists.**  \n   - **Not covered.**  \n     - The generated model has a `vehicle structure view` as a tree, but not named `HierarchyTree`.\n67-87. **All the specific `show` statements.**  \n   - **Partially covered.**  \n     - The generated model exposes the full part hierarchy of `vehicle` as a tree, but the structure and naming are different, and many parts are missing.\n\n#### SafetyComponentsTable\n88. **View `SafetyComponentsTable` exists.**  \n   - **Partially covered.**  \n     - The generated model has a `safety features view` as a table.\n89-92. **Shows for safety attributes.**  \n   - **Partially covered.**  \n     - The generated model shows all parts with `@Safety` and their attributes, but the mapping to the reference model's components is not exact.\n\n#### NonSafetyComponentsTable\n93. **View `NonSafetyComponentsTable` exists.**  \n   - **Partially covered.**  \n     - The generated model has a `non-safety features view` as a table.\n94-102. **Shows for non-safety components.**  \n   - **Partially covered.**  \n     - The generated model shows all parts without `@Safety`, but the mapping to the reference model's components is not exact.\n\n#### SafetyComponentsTree\n103. **View `SafetyComponentsTree` exists.**  \n   - **Not covered.**\n104-107. **Shows for safety components in tree.**  \n   - **Not covered.**\n\n#### NonSafetyComponentsTree\n108. **View `NonSafetyComponentsTree` exists.**  \n   - **Not covered.**\n109-117. **Shows for non-safety components in tree.**  \n   - **Not covered.**\n\n---\n\n### Let's count the covered claims\n\n#### **Fully covered:**\n- None.\n\n#### **Partially covered (count as covered if the core semantics are present):**\n- 55-62: The safety attributes for bumper, seatbelt, airbag, ABS are present, though with a different mechanism (`@Safety{isMandatory = ...}` instead of two attributes and an enum). Let's count these 8 claims as covered.\n- 65: The concept of mandatory/optional is present as a Boolean, not an enum. Let's count as covered.\n- 88-93: The existence of safety and non-safety features tables/views, and their content, is present, though not with the same names or exact mapping. Let's count these 6 claims as covered.\n\n#### **Other possible covered claims:**\n- The generated model does have a hierarchical part structure for a vehicle, with parts like `seatBelt`, `bumper`, `driverAirBag`, `antilockBrakes`, `interior`, `bodyAssy`, `wheelAssy`, etc. This covers the general idea of a hierarchical decomposition, but not the specific structure or naming of the reference model. Let's count the following as covered:\n  - The existence of a root part (`vehicle`) and its decomposition into subparts (interior, bodyAssy, wheelAssy).\n  - The presence of parts corresponding to seat belts, bumpers, airbags, ABS (as antilockBrakes), and their safety attributes.\n\nLet's enumerate the claims that are at least partially covered:\n\n- 55. BumperComponent has attribute safetyRelated: Boolean = true.\n- 56. BumperComponent has attribute safetyStatus: SafetyStatus = mandatory.\n- 57. SeatBeltComponent has attribute safetyRelated: Boolean = true.\n- 58. SeatBeltComponent has attribute safetyStatus: SafetyStatus = mandatory.\n- 59. AirbagComponent has attribute safetyRelated: Boolean = true.\n- 60. AirbagComponent has attribute safetyStatus: SafetyStatus = optional.\n- 61. ABSComponent has attribute safetyRelated: Boolean = true.\n- 62. ABSComponent has attribute safetyStatus: SafetyStatus = optional.\n- 65. Definition of enum SafetyStatus with values mandatory, optional (as Boolean).\n- 88. View SafetyComponentsTable exists (as safety features view).\n- 89. SafetyComponentsTable shows BumperComponent.safetyRelated, BumperComponent.safetyStatus.\n- 90. SafetyComponentsTable shows SeatBeltComponent.safetyRelated, SeatBeltComponent.safetyStatus.\n- 91. SafetyComponentsTable shows AirbagComponent.safetyRelated, AirbagComponent.safetyStatus.\n- 92. SafetyComponentsTable shows ABSComponent.safetyRelated, ABSComponent.safetyStatus.\n- 93. View NonSafetyComponentsTable exists (as non-safety features view).\n- 94. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows EngineComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 95. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows TransmissionComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 96. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows SuspensionComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 97. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows WheelsComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 98. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows BrakesComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 99. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows DoorsComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 100. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows WindowsComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 101. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows DisplayComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n- 102. NonSafetyComponentsTable shows AudioComponent (not present, but the view exists).\n\nBut for 94-102, the actual components are not present, only the view. So, only the existence of the view (93) is covered, not the specific content.\n\nSo, the covered claims are:\n- 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 65, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93\n\n**Total covered claims: 15**\n\n---\n\n## 3.
