The attribute is present, but on a different class.\n   - **Partially covered** (attribute present, but not on the correct specialization)\n   - **Not covered**\n10. **Part `RearAxle` extends `Axle`**: Not present.\n    - **Not covered**\n11. **Part `Vehicle` extends `VehicleComponent`**: `Vehicle` exists, but not as a subtype of `VehicleComponent`.\n    - **Not covered**\n12. **`Vehicle` has attribute `mass: Real = 1750`**: Present (`mass` attribute with default 1750).\n    - **Covered**\n13. **`Vehicle` contains part `frontAxle: FrontAxle`**: In generated, `Vehicle` contains `frontAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly` which contains `frontAxle: Axle`. In the variant, this is redefined as `FrontAxle`. So, **covered via redefinition**.\n    - **Covered**\n14. **`Vehicle` contains part `rearAxle: RearAxle`**: In generated, `Vehicle` contains `rearAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly` which contains `rearAxle: Axle`. No explicit `RearAxle` type, but the structure is present.\n    - **Partially covered** (structure present, but not the type)\n    - **Not covered**\n\n### Variant: vehicle1_c1\n15. **Part `vehicle1_c1` extends `Vehicle`**: Present (`vehicle1_c1 :> vehicle1`, and `vehicle1` is a `Vehicle`).\n    - **Covered**\n16. **`vehicle1_c1` overrides attribute `mass` to 2000**: Present.\n    - **Covered**\n17. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxle` is of type `SteeringFrontAxle`**: In generated, `frontAxle_c1` is of type `FrontAxle` (no `SteeringFrontAxle`).\n    - **Not covered**\n18. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxle` overrides attribute `mass` to 350**: Not present.\n    - **Not covered**\n19. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxle` overrides attribute `steeringAngle` to 35**: Not present.\n    - **Not covered**\n20. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxle`'s `tires[1]` is a `Tire` with `mass` 12**: In generated, `frontWheel_1` exists, but no mass attribute or type override.\n    - **Not covered**\n21. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxle`'s `tires[2]` is a `Tire` with `mass` 12**: Same as above.\n    - **Not covered**\n22. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `rearAxle` is a `RearAxle` with `mass` 300**: In generated, `rearAxle_c1` exists, but no type `RearAxle` or mass override.\n    - **Not covered**\n23. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `rearAxle`'s `tires[1]` is a `Tire` with `mass` 10**: In generated, `rearWheel_1` exists, but no mass attribute or type override.\n    - **Not covered**\n24. **In `vehicle1_c1`, `rearAxle`'s `tires[2]` is a `Tire` with `mass` 10**: Same as above.\n    - **Not covered**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- 1. Package: **Covered**\n- 7. FrontAxle extends Axle: **Covered**\n- 12. Vehicle has mass attribute with default: **Covered**\n- 13. Vehicle contains frontAxle: **Covered**\n- 15. vehicle1_c1 extends Vehicle: **Covered**\n- 16. vehicle1_c1 overrides mass: **Covered**\n\n**Total covered: 6**\n\n**Total claims: 24**\n\n---\n\n### **Score: 6/24**"

However, `bodyAssy` is the body assembly, so it's a reasonable mapping. (11: covered)\n- Vehicle has part chassis: `wheelAssy` is the chassis assembly, so it's a reasonable mapping. (12: covered)\n\n#### VehicleInterior (13-16)\n- `interior` is present (13: covered)\n- `interior` has `seatBelt[2]` (14: covered)\n- `interior` has `driverAirBag` (not named airbag, but functionally equivalent, and multiplicity is 1, which is within [0..1]) (15: covered)\n- `interior` has `alarm` (antiTheftAlarm), but no explicit multiplicity. The reference model requires [1], but the generated model does not specify. We'll accept this as covered. (16: covered)\n\n#### VehicleBody (17-19)\n- `bodyAssy` is present (17: covered)\n- `bodyAssy` has `bumper` (18: covered)\n- `bodyAssy` has `keylessEntry` (19: covered)\n\n#### ChassisStructure (20-22)\n- `wheelAssy` is present (20: covered)\n- `wheelAssy` has `wheel[2]` (21: covered)\n- `wheelAssy` has `antilockBrakes[2]` (reference model allows [0..2], generated model has [2]; this is a subset, but the structure is present) (22: covered)\n\n#### SeatBelt (23-24)\n- `seatBelt` is present as a part, but is there a type definition? The generated model uses metadata to annotate parts, not explicit block definitions.\n- `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}` on `seatBelt` covers the attribute isSafetyFeature: Boolean = true and isMandatory = true (though the reference model only has isSafetyFeature). We'll accept this as covered for both the part and the attribute. (23: covered, 24: covered)\n\n#### Airbag (25-27)\n- `driverAirBag` is present, annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`. This covers both isSafetyFeature: Boolean = true and isMandatory: Boolean = false. (25: covered, 26: covered, 27: covered)\n\n#### AntiTheftAlarm (28-29)\n- `alarm` is present, annotated with `@Security;`. No attribute isSecurityFeature, but the annotation is equivalent. (28: covered, 29: covered)\n\n#### Bumper (30-31)\n- `bumper` is present, annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`. isSafetyFeature: Boolean = true is covered. (30: covered, 31: covered)\n\n#### KeylessEntrySystem (32-33)\n- `keylessEntry` is present, annotated with `@Security;`. isSecurityFeature: Boolean = true is covered. (32: covered, 33: covered)\n\n#### Wheel (34)\n- `wheel` is present as a part, but no block definition. The generated model does not define a block for Wheel, only a part. (34: Not covered)\n\n#### AntiLockBrakingSystem (35-37)\n- `antilockBrakes` is present as a part, annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`. No explicit block definition, but the annotation covers the attributes. (35: Not covered, 36: covered, 37: covered)\n\n#### IdentificationAndClassificationManager (38-39)\n- No such block or operation in the generated model. (38: Not covered, 39: Not covered)\n\n#### SafetyOrSecurityComponent (40)\n- No such interface in the generated model. (40: Not covered)\n\n#### ComplianceStatus (41)\n- No such block in the generated model. (41: Not covered)\n\n### Satisfy Relationships (42-49)\n- No satisfy relationships are present in the generated model. (42-49: Not covered)\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Requirements: 0/8\n- Blocks and Parts:\n    - Vehicle: 4/4\n    - VehicleInterior: 4/4\n    - VehicleBody: 3/3\n    - ChassisStructure: 3/3\n    - SeatBelt: 2/2\n    - Airbag: 3/3\n    - AntiTheftAlarm: 2/2\n    - Bumper: 2/2\n    - KeylessEntrySystem: 2/2\n    - Wheel: 0/1\n    - AntiLockBrakingSystem: 2/3 (no block definition, but attributes covered)\n    - IdentificationAndClassificationManager: 0/2\n    - SafetyOrSecurityComponent: 0/1\n    - ComplianceStatus: 0/1\n- Satisfy relationships: 0/8\n\nLet's sum up the covered claims:\n\n- Requirements: 0\n- Vehicle: 4\n- VehicleInterior: 4\n- VehicleBody: 3\n- ChassisStructure: 3\n- SeatBelt: 2\n- Airbag: 3\n- AntiTheftAlarm: 2\n- Bumper: 2\n- KeylessEntrySystem: 2\n- Wheel: 0\n- AntiLockBrakingSystem: 2\n- IdentificationAndClassificationManager: 0\n- SafetyOrSecurityComponent: 0\n- ComplianceStatus: 0\n- Satisfy relationships: 0\n\nTotal covered: 0 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = **27**\n\n**Total claims: 49**\n\n---\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n**Score: 27/49**"

It does not define any FMEA structure, types, or metadata, nor does it define any of the structural or type elements in the generated model.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n- **Claims 1–59 (FMEALibrary and FMEAMetadata):**  \n  None of these types, attributes, or metadata definitions are present in the reference model. The reference model only defines requirements and their relationships (derivesFrom, satisfies), not FMEA structures, types, or metadata.\n\n- **Claims 60–86 (FMEAUserModel):**  \n  - Claims 60–62: Definitions of requirements req1, req2, req3. The reference model defines requirements, but not with these names or structure. The requirements in the reference model are: HighReliabilityAndSafety, BatteryStatusDetection, UserAlertOnBatteryIssue, PreventiveMeasuresForBattery, AlarmAndEmergencyResponse, RigorousApprovalOfRequirements, RiskManagementForKeyScenarios. There is no mapping or equivalence stated between req1/req2/req3 and the reference requirements.\n  - Claims 63–65: Metadata and attributes for req3 (StatusHolder, documentation, sil). Not present in the reference model.\n  - Claims 66–86: FMEA item definitions, connections, parts, events, and their relationships. None of these are present in the reference model, which only defines requirements and their relationships.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNone of the atomic claims in the generated model are supported by the reference model.

However, the structure is the same: a package containing the model. So, **Supported**.)\n\n2. **Definition of subpackage 'PayloadDefinitions'.**  \n   - Reference model does not use subpackages, but does define types for messages and flows.  \n   - **Not supported** (subpackage structure is not present, but the types defined within are present; per instructions, focus on structure/semantics, so the grouping is not essential. **Supported**.)\n\n3. **Import of 'ScalarValues::*'.**  \n   - Reference model does not mention imports.  \n   - **Not supported** (imports are not part of the reference model's atomic claims.)\n\n4. **Import of 'PayloadDefinitions::*'.**  \n   - Same as above.  \n   - **Not supported**\n\n5. **Definition of item 'Subscribe'.**  \n   - Reference model has 'flow SubscriptionRequest' with similar semantics.  \n   - **Supported**\n\n6. **'Subscribe' has attribute 'topic' of type String.**  \n   - Reference model: 'SubscriptionRequest' has 'topic: Topic'. 'Topic' is a type, not a String, but the concept is the same.  \n   - **Supported**\n\n7. **'Subscribe' has reference 'subscriber' to a part.**  \n   - Reference model: 'SubscriptionRequest' has 'consumer: Consumer'.  \n   - 'subscriber' and 'consumer' are semantically equivalent.  \n   - **Supported**\n\n8. **Definition of item 'Publish'.**  \n   - Reference model: 'flow PublishRequest'.  \n   - **Supported**\n\n9. **'Publish' has attribute 'topic' of type String.**  \n   - Reference model: 'PublishRequest' has 'message: Message', and 'Message' has 'topic: Topic'.  \n   - The generated model flattens the structure, but the information is present.  \n   - **Supported**\n\n10. **'Publish' has reference 'publication'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'PublishRequest' has 'message: Message'.  \n    - 'publication' is equivalent to 'message'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n11. **Definition of item 'Deliver'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'flow Delivery'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n12. **'Deliver' has reference 'publication'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'Delivery' has 'message: Message'.  \n    - 'publication' is equivalent to 'message'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n13. **Definition of occurrence 'PubSubSequence'.**  \n    - Reference model: system structure is defined as 'part system: PublishSubscribeSystem' with parts and connections.  \n    - 'Occurrence' is a different modeling construct, but the structure is similar.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n14. **'PubSubSequence' has part 'producer' (multiplicity 1).**  \n    - Reference model: 'producers: Producer[*]'.  \n    - Multiplicity differs (1 vs *), but the part exists.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n15. **'producer' has event 'publish_message.source'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'publishMessage' action in 'ProducerBehavior', with output 'publishRequest'.  \n    - 'publish_message' event is equivalent to 'publishMessage' action.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n16. **'PubSubSequence' has message 'publish_message' of type 'Publish' (multiplicity 1).**  \n    - Reference model: 'publishRequest: PublishRequest'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n17. **'PubSubSequence' has part 'server' (multiplicity 1).**  \n    - Reference model: 'server: Server'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n18. **'server' has event 'subscribe_message.target'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'receiveSubscription' action in 'ServerBehavior', input 'subscriptionRequest'.  \n    - 'subscribe_message' event is equivalent to 'SubscriptionRequest'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n19. **'server' has event 'publish_message.target'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'receivePublish' action in 'ServerBehavior', input 'publishRequest'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n20. **'server' has event 'deliver_message.source'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'deliverToSubscribers' action in 'ServerBehavior', output 'deliveries: Delivery[*]'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n21. **'PubSubSequence' has message 'subscribe_message' of type 'Subscribe' (multiplicity 1).**  \n    - Reference model: 'subscriptionRequest: SubscriptionRequest'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n22. **'PubSubSequence' has message 'deliver_message' of type 'Deliver' (multiplicity 1).**  \n    - Reference model: 'deliveries: Delivery[*]'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n23. **'PubSubSequence' has part 'consumer' (multiplicity 1).**  \n    - Reference model: 'consumers: Consumer[*]'.  \n    - Multiplicity differs, but part exists.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n24. **'consumer' has event 'subscribe_message.source'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'subscribeToTopic' action in 'ConsumerBehavior', output 'subscriptionRequest'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n25. **'consumer' has event 'deliver_message.target'.**  \n    - Reference model: 'receiveMessage' action in 'ConsumerBehavior', input 'delivery: Delivery'.  \n    - **Supported**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n- Claims not supported: 3 (claims 3 and 4: imports; claim 2 is supported as per instructions)\n- Supported claims: 23\n- Total claims: 25\n\n**Score: 23/25**",

However, the package is just a container, so not a meaningful modeling element for system structure.

However, there is a constraint for continuous monitoring of the brake pedal sensor.  \n   - **Partially supported** (the concept of monitoring the brake pedal is present, but not as an explicit action).  \n   - **Let's count as supported, since the monitoring of brake pedal sensor is a core function.**\n\n6. **Action MonitorTraction (with output 'modFreq' of type Real).**  \n   - The reference model has a TractionSensor with 'roadAdhesion' attribute, and constraints for monitoring and for calculating modulation frequency.  \n   - The output 'modFreq' (modulation frequency) is calculated by the BrakingControlUnit, not directly by monitoring traction.  \n   - **Not supported** (the action of monitoring traction is present, but the output is not modulation frequency; it's road adhesion).  \n   - **Not supported.**\n\n7. **Action Braking (with inputs 'brakePressure' and 'modulationFrequency').**  \n   - The reference model has a BrakeActuator with 'brakePressure' and 'modulationFrequency' attributes, and constraints for setting these based on calculations.  \n   - The concept of a 'Braking' action that takes these as inputs is not explicit, but the structure is similar.  \n   - **Supported** (the process of applying brake pressure and modulation frequency is present).\n\n8. **Action Brake (composite action).**  \n   - The reference model has the overall system behavior, but not as a single 'Brake' action.  \n   - **Partially supported** (the system coordinates these actions, but not as a single action).  \n   - **Let's count as supported, as the system orchestrates these steps.**\n\n9. **Sub-action TurnOn.**  \n   - The reference model has 'ignitionKey.position == #start' as a condition for activation.  \n   - 'TurnOn' is analogous to turning the ignition key to 'start'.  \n   - **Supported.**\n\n10. **Sub-action monitorBrakePedal (of type MonitorBrakePedal, with output).**  \n    - As above, monitoring the brake pedal sensor is present.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n11. **Sub-action monitorTraction (of type MonitorTraction, with output).**  \n    - Monitoring traction is present, but the output should be 'roadAdhesion', not 'modulationFrequency'.  \n    - **Not supported.**\n\n12. **Data flow: monitorBrakePedal.brakePressure → braking.brakePressure**  \n    - The reference model uses brakePedalSensor.brakePressure as input to calculate brake pressure.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n13. **Data flow: monitorTraction.modulationFrequency → braking.modulationFrequency**  \n    - The reference model calculates modulation frequency from roadAdhesion, not directly from monitoring traction.  \n    - **Not supported.**\n\n14. **Sub-action braking (of type Braking, with inputs).**  \n    - The process of applying brake pressure and modulation frequency is present.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- 5.

Reference model uses 'shutdownSignal' to transition from 'Started' to 'ShuttingDown', then to 'Off' after 'applyParkingBrake'.

'c' has a part 'engine' with 'simpleMass' set to 100[kg].\n24. 'c' has a part 'transmission' with 'simpleMass' set to 50[kg].\n25. The total mass of 'c' is 1150.0[kg].\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model\n\n#### 1. The package is named 'VehicleMassAggregation'.\n- **Not supported** (Reference model's package is 'VehicleMassManagement', but naming differences are to be ignored if structure matches. However, the package name itself is not a structural element, so we can ignore this.)\n\n#### 2. The package imports ScalarValues::*.\n- **Not supported** (Reference model imports sysml::blocks, sysml::constraints, sysml::expressions, sysml::values.)\n\n#### 3. The package imports NumericalFunctions::*.\n- **Not supported** (Same as above.)\n\n#### 4. There is a part definition 'MassedThing'.\n- **Supported** (Corresponds to 'VehicleComponent' block in reference model.)\n\n#### 5. 'MassedThing' has an attribute 'simpleMass' of type ISQ::mass.\n- **Supported** (Corresponds to 'mass: Mass' attribute in 'VehicleComponent'. ISQ::mass and Mass are both mass value types.)\n\n#### 6. 'MassedThing' has an attribute 'totalMass' of type ISQ::mass, defaulting to 'simpleMass'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model defines 'totalMass' operation in 'VehicleComponent', which by default returns 'mass' if no subcomponents.)\n\n#### 7. There is a part 'compositeThing' that extends 'MassedThing'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'VehicleComponent' has subcomponents, so a composite pattern is present.)\n\n#### 8. 'compositeThing' has a part 'subcomponents' of type 'MassedThing[*]'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'VehicleComponent' has 'subcomponents: VehicleComponent[0..*]'.)\n\n#### 9. 'compositeThing' redefines 'totalMass' as 'simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'totalMass' operation sums own mass and subcomponents' totalMass.)\n\n#### 10. There is a part 'filteredMassThing' that extends 'compositeThing'.\n- **Partially supported** (Reference model: 'totalMass' operation in 'VehicleComponent' and 'Vehicle' supports threshold filtering, but there is no explicit 'filteredMassThing' block.)\n\n#### 11. 'filteredMassThing' has an attribute 'minMass' of type ISQ::mass.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'totalMass' operation takes 'threshold: Mass' parameter.)\n\n#### 12. 'filteredMassThing' redefines 'totalMass' as 'simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass where p >= minMass)'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'totalMass' operation sums only subcomponents with mass >= threshold.)\n\n#### 13. There is a part definition 'CarPart' that extends 'MassedThing'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'VehicleComponent' is extended by 'Engine', 'Transmission', and used as a part in 'Vehicle'.)\n\n#### 14. 'CarPart' has an attribute 'serialNumber' of type String.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'VehicleComponent' has 'serialNumber: SerialNumber', where 'SerialNumber' is a value type based on String.)\n\n#### 15. There is a part 'car' of type 'CarPart' that extends 'compositeThing'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'Vehicle' block aggregates 'VehicleComponent' and has similar structure.)\n\n#### 16. 'car' has an attribute 'vin' mapped to 'serialNumber'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'Vehicle' has 'vin: VIN', and 'VIN' is a value type based on String. The mapping is not explicit, but the attribute is present.)\n\n#### 17. 'car' has a part 'carParts' of type 'CarPart[*]' mapped to 'subcomponents'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'Vehicle' has 'components: VehicleComponent[0..*]'.)\n\n#### 18. 'car' has a part 'engine' that is a specialization of 'carParts'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'Vehicle' has 'engine: Engine', and 'Engine' extends 'VehicleComponent'.)\n\n#### 19. 'car' has a part 'transmission' that is a specialization of 'carParts'.\n- **Supported** (Reference model: 'Vehicle' has 'transmission: Transmission', and 'Transmission' extends 'VehicleComponent'.)\n\n#### 20. The package imports SI::kg.\n- **Not supported** (Reference model does not explicitly import SI::kg, but uses 'kg' as a unit.)\n\n#### 21. There is a part 'c' of type 'car'.\n- **Not supported** (Reference model does not instantiate a specific 'Vehicle' instance.)\n\n#### 22. 'c' has 'simpleMass' set to 1000[kg].\n- **Not supported** (Reference model does not provide instance-level values.)\n\n#### 23. 'c' has a part 'engine' with 'simpleMass' set to 100[kg].\n- **Not supported** (Reference model does not provide instance-level values.)\n\n#### 24. 'c' has a part 'transmission' with 'simpleMass' set to 50[kg].\n- **Not supported** (Reference model does not provide instance-level values.)\n\n#### 25. The total mass of 'c' is 1150.0[kg].\n- **Not supported** (Reference model does not provide instance-level values or calculations.)\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Calculation Power with inputs: whlpwr (PowerValue), Cd (Real), Cf (Real), tm (MassValue), v (SpeedValue).\n   - Reference model has constraints for tractive force, drag, and rolling resistance, but not a single \"Power\" calculation. The generated model combines these into one. The inputs correspond to wheelPower, aeroDragCoeff, rollingResistCoeff, vehicleMass, and speed. **Partially supported** (structure is different, but the elements exist).

In updateState, attribute totalPower: PowerValue = Power(wheelPower, C_d, C_f, mass, currState.v).\n    - Reference model: simulateStep computes tractive, drag, rolling, netForce, etc. The generated model's totalPower is not equivalent to any single value in the reference model. **Not supported.**\n\n24. updateState returns attribute newState: DynamicState, with:\n    - v = Velocity(delta_t, currState.v, Acceleration(totalPower, mass, currState.v))\n    - x = Position(delta_t, currState.x, currState.v)\n    - Reference model: simulateStep updates speed and position using acceleration, speed, and dt.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### **A. Imports**\n1. Import of ScalarValues.\\*  \n   - **Partial**: The generated model imports `ScalarValues::Real` and `ISQ::*`. Not a perfect match, but covers the use of real numbers and SI units.\n2. Import of SI.\\*  \n   - **Covered**: `ISQ::*` is imported, which is a standard SI unit library.\n\n#### **B. Part: VehicleSystem**\n3. Definition of part `VehicleSystem`  \n   - **Not covered**: No explicit part definition; the model is function-based.\n4. Attribute `initialPosition: Length`  \n   - **Covered**: Present as `x_in : LengthValue` in action and as `x_i` in constraints.\n5. Attribute `initialVelocity: Velocity`  \n   - **Covered**: Present as `v_in : SpeedValue` and `v_i`.\n6. Attribute `vehicleMass: Mass`  \n   - **Covered**: Present as `mass : MassValue` and `m`.\n7.

Definition of function `F_drag(v: Velocity) = 0.5 * airDensity * dragCoefficient * frontalArea * v^2`  \n    - **Not covered**: Drag is modeled as `Cd * v`, which is a simplification and omits air density and frontal area.\n18.

Definition of function `F_net(v: Velocity) = F_drive(v) - F_total(v)`  \n    - **Partially covered**: The generated model's `Power` function is similar but not equivalent.\n22. Assignment: `acceleration = F_net(initialVelocity) / vehicleMass`  \n    - **Partially covered**: The generated model computes acceleration as `tp / (tm * v)`, which is not the same.\n23. Assignment: `finalVelocity = initialVelocity + acceleration * timeInterval`  \n    - **Covered**: `v_f == Velocity(dt, v_i, a)`\n24. Assignment: `finalPosition = initialPosition + initialVelocity * timeInterval + 0.5 * acceleration * timeInterval^2`  \n    - **Not covered**: The generated model uses `x_f == Position(dt, x_i, v_avg)`, which is a simpler formula.\n\n#### **D.

The generated model uses ISQ::mass, which is a generalization, but the intent is the same (mass attribute with unit kg). **Supported**.\n6. **AxleAssembly part definition**: **Supported**.\n7. **Axle part definition**: **Supported**.\n8. **Axle.mass attribute (ISQ::mass)**: Reference model does **not** have a 'mass' attribute for 'Axle'. **Not supported**.\n9. **FrontAxle extends Axle**: **Supported**.\n10. **FrontAxle.steeringAngle: ScalarValues::Real**: Reference has 'attribute steeringAngle: SteeringAngleValue' in 'SteeringFrontAxle', not in 'FrontAxle'. In the reference, 'FrontAxle' does not have 'steeringAngle'; only 'SteeringFrontAxle' does. **Not supported**.\n11. **Wheel part definition**: **Supported**.\n\n#### **C. Usages and Instances**\n12. **Usages package**: Not relevant; just a container. **Ignore.**\n13. **Private import of Definitions**: Not a modeling claim. **Ignore.**\n14. **vehicle1: Vehicle**: **Supported** (reference has 'vehicle_1750kg: Vehicle').\n15. **vehicle1.mass = 1750 kg**: **Supported**.\n16. **vehicle1.frontAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly**: **Supported**.\n17. **frontAxleAssembly.frontAxle: Axle**: In the reference, 'AxleAssembly' has 'part axle: Axle', not 'frontAxle'. The generated model uses 'frontAxle' as the part name, but the type and structure are the same. **Supported** (ignoring naming).\n18. **frontAxleAssembly.frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered**: In the reference, 'Axle' has 'part wheel[2]: Wheel ordered', and 'AxleAssembly' contains 'axle: Axle'. The generated model puts 'frontWheel' directly in 'AxleAssembly', which is a structural difference. In the reference, wheels are contained in 'Axle', not in 'AxleAssembly'. **Not supported**.\n19. **vehicle1.rearAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly**: **Supported**.\n20. **rearAxleAssembly.rearAxle: Axle**: Same as above; naming difference, but structure matches. **Supported**.\n21. **rearAxleAssembly.rearWheel: Wheel[2] ordered**: Same as claim 18; in the reference, wheels are in 'Axle', not in 'AxleAssembly'. **Not supported**.\n\n22. **vehicle1_c1: Vehicle**: Reference has 'vehicle_2000kg: VehicleWithSteeringFrontAxle', which is a specialization of 'Vehicle'. The generated model uses 'Vehicle' as the type, which is less specific. **Partially supported** (but not a direct match; let's be strict and say **Not supported**).\n23. **vehicle1_c1.mass = 2000 kg**: **Supported**.\n24. **vehicle1_c1.frontAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly**: **Supported**.\n25. **frontAxleAssembly.frontAxle: FrontAxle**: In the reference, 'frontAxleAssembly' contains 'axle: SteeringFrontAxle' (which extends 'FrontAxle'). The generated model uses 'FrontAxle', which is less specific. **Not supported**.\n26. **frontAxleAssembly.frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered**: Same as claim 18; wheels are in 'Axle', not in 'AxleAssembly'. **Not supported**.\n27. **frontAxleAssembly.frontWheel_1 subsets frontWheel = frontWheel#(1)**: In the reference, 'VehicleWithNamedWheels' has 'wheel[2]: Wheel { name = \"FrontLeft\", \"FrontRight\"; }', i.e., named wheels, but not as subsetting parts. The generated model uses subsetting to name the wheels, which is a different mechanism, but the intent is to name the wheels. **Supported** (semantics match).\n28. **frontAxleAssembly.frontWheel_2 subsets frontWheel = frontWheel#(2)**: Same as above. **Supported**.\n29. **vehicle1_c1.rearAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly**: **Supported**.\n30. **rearAxleAssembly.rearAxle: Axle**: In the reference, 'axle: RearAxle' (a specialization of 'Axle'). The generated model uses 'Axle', which is less specific. **Not supported**.\n31. **rearAxleAssembly.rearWheel: Wheel[2] ordered**: Same as claim 18; wheels are in 'Axle', not in 'AxleAssembly'. **Not supported**.\n32. **rearAxleAssembly.rearWheel_1 subsets rearWheel = rearWheel#(1)**: In the reference, 'VehicleWithNamedWheels' has 'wheel[2]: Wheel { name = \"RearLeft\", \"RearRight\"; }', i.e., named wheels, but not as subsetting parts. The generated model uses subsetting to name the wheels, which is a different mechanism, but the intent is to name the wheels. **Supported**.\n33. **rearAxleAssembly.rearWheel_2 subsets rearWheel = rearWheel#(2)**: Same as above. **Supported**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's go through each claim:\n\n### Value Types\n\n1. **MassValue value type (unit: kg, base: Real):**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model uses `ISQ::mass` and `kg`, but does not define a custom value type `MassValue` with unit and base.\n2. **SteeringAngleValue value type (unit: deg, base: Real):**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model uses `ScalarValues::Real` for `steeringAngle`, but does not define a value type with unit `deg`.\n\n### Part Definitions\n\n3. **Wheel part definition:**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def Wheel;`\n4. **Wheel has attribute name:String:**  \n   - **Not covered.** No attribute `name` in `Wheel` in the generated model.\n5. **Axle part definition:**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def Axle { ... }`\n6. **Axle has part wheel[2]:Wheel ordered:**  \n   - **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `Axle` does not have a `wheel` part. However, in the instance usages, `frontAxle` and `rearAxle` have `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered` and `rearWheel: Wheel[2] ordered`. But the definition is not in `Axle` itself.  \n   - **Not covered.**\n7. **FrontAxle extends Axle:**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def FrontAxle :> Axle`\n8. **SteeringFrontAxle extends FrontAxle:**  \n   - **Not covered.** No `SteeringFrontAxle` in the generated model.\n9. **SteeringFrontAxle has attribute steeringAngle:SteeringAngleValue:**  \n   - **Not covered.** No `SteeringFrontAxle` at all.\n10. **RearAxle extends Axle:**  \n    - **Not covered.** No `RearAxle` in the generated model.\n11. **AxleAssembly part definition:**  \n    - **Covered.** `part def AxleAssembly;`\n12. **AxleAssembly has part axle:Axle:**  \n    - **Not covered.** No `axle` part in `AxleAssembly` in the generated model.\n13. **Vehicle part definition:**  \n    - **Covered.** `part def Vehicle { ... }`\n14. **Vehicle has attribute mass:MassValue:**  \n    - **Partially covered.** `Vehicle` has `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass`, which is similar, but not the custom value type.  \n    - **Covered** (accepting type equivalence for recall).\n15. **Vehicle has part frontAxleAssembly:AxleAssembly:**  \n    - **Not covered in definition.** In the generated model, `frontAxleAssembly` is only present in the instance, not in the definition of `Vehicle`.\n16. **Vehicle has part rearAxleAssembly:AxleAssembly:**  \n    - **Not covered in definition.** Same as above.\n17. **VehicleWithSteeringFrontAxle extends Vehicle:**  \n    - **Not covered.** No such part definition in the generated model.\n18. **VehicleWithSteeringFrontAxle redefines frontAxleAssembly to have axle:SteeringFrontAxle:**  \n    - **Not covered.**\n19. **VehicleWithNamedWheels extends Vehicle:**  \n    - **Not covered.**\n20. **VehicleWithNamedWheels redefines frontAxleAssembly to have axle:FrontAxle with two Wheel parts named \"FrontLeft\" and \"FrontRight\":**  \n    - **Partially covered.** In the generated model, in the instance, there are two front wheels, but not named.\n    - **Not covered.**\n21. **VehicleWithNamedWheels redefines rearAxleAssembly to have axle:RearAxle with two Wheel parts named \"RearLeft\" and \"RearRight\":**  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n### Instances\n\n22. **Part vehicle_1750kg:Vehicle with mass=1750kg:**  \n    - **Covered.** `vehicle1: Vehicle` with `mass = 1750 [kg]`.\n23. **Part vehicle_2000kg:VehicleWithSteeringFrontAxle with mass=2000kg and frontAxleAssembly.axle.steeringAngle=15deg:**  \n    - **Partially covered.** There is `vehicle1_c1: Vehicle` with `mass = 2000 [kg]`, and `frontAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly { frontAxle: FrontAxle { ... } }`, but no `steeringAngle` attribute or value.  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- 3. Wheel part definition\n- 5. Axle part definition\n- 7. FrontAxle extends Axle\n- 11. AxleAssembly part definition\n- 13. Vehicle part definition\n- 14. Vehicle has attribute mass (accepting type equivalence)\n- 22. vehicle_1750kg instance\n\n**Total covered: 7**\n\n**Total claims: 23**\n\n---\n\n**Score: 7/23**"
