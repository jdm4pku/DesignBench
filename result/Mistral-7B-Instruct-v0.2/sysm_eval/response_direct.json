The reference model uses `CylinderSubsystem`, but the generated model uses `Cylinder`. If we treat `Cylinder` as equivalent to `CylinderSubsystem`, this is covered, though the generated model uses a multiplicity instead of a container object. The semantics are similar (a set of cylinders vs. a subsystem with a count), but not identical. For recall, if we accept this as equivalent, **Covered**.\n\n#### 7. The model defines a type `CylinderSubsystem`.\n- **Partially Covered**: The generated model defines `Cylinder`, not `CylinderSubsystem`. If we treat `Cylinder` as equivalent, **Covered**.\n\n#### 8. `CylinderSubsystem` has an attribute/part `numberOfCylinders` of type `int`.\n- **Not Covered**: The generated model does not define an attribute `numberOfCylinders` for `Cylinder` (or any equivalent). Instead, the number of cylinders is represented by the multiplicity `[4..6]` in the `Engine`'s part. This is a structural difference: the reference model uses an explicit attribute, the generated model uses multiplicity. For recall, this is **Not Covered**.\n\n#### 9. The model defines a type `SmallEngine` as a subtype of `Engine`.\n- **Covered**: `part def SmallEngine :> Engine { ... }`\n\n#### 10. `SmallEngine` has an attribute/part `numberOfCylinders` of type `int` with default value 4.\n- **Partially Covered**: In the generated model, `SmallEngine` redefines `cyl[4]`, i.e., it has 4 cylinders. This is equivalent in effect to having `numberOfCylinders = 4`, but the attribute is not explicitly present. For recall, if we accept this as equivalent, **Covered**.\n\n#### 11. The model defines a type `LargeEngine` as a subtype of `Engine`.\n- **Covered**: `part def BigEngine :> Engine { ... }` (naming difference, but structure/semantics match)\n\n#### 12. `LargeEngine` has an attribute/part `numberOfCylinders` of type `int` with default value 6.\n- **Partially Covered**: In the generated model, `BigEngine` redefines `cyl[6]`, i.e., it has 6 cylinders. This is equivalent in effect to having `numberOfCylinders = 6`, but the attribute is not explicitly present. For recall, if we accept this as equivalent, **Covered**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count:\n\n- **Covered**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 (if we accept the structural equivalence for 6, 7, 10, 12)\n- **Not Covered**: 8 (explicit attribute `numberOfCylinders` in `CylinderSubsystem`)\n\n**Total claims:** 12  \n**Covered claims:** 11\n\n---\n\n**Score: 11/12**"

So, **covered**.\n- Claims 8, 10, 16, 18: The specific names \"HotWater\" and \"ColdWater\" are not present, but the function is.

The `Vehicle` block contains a block named `Powertrain`.\n- **Not covered.** The generated model has `Engine` and `Transmission` as parts, but not a `Powertrain` block.\n\n#### 10. The `Powertrain` block has an attribute `powerOutput` of type `real`.\n- **Not covered.** No such attribute.\n\n#### 11. The `Powertrain` block has an attribute `fuelConsumption` of type `real`.\n- **Not covered.** No such attribute.\n\n#### 12.

If we are generous and count partial coverage for claim 13 (since `cargoWeight` is a direct analog for `Load.mass`), we can count it as covered.

However, it does have a subpackage \"PartsTree\" with a \"vehicle\" part, which is a partial match. For strictness, let's say **not covered**.\n\n2. **Type \"SafetyFeature\" exists.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model does not define a type named \"SafetyFeature\", but it does use a metadata annotation \"@Safety\" with an attribute \"isMandatory\". This is a partial semantic match, but not a direct type definition. For recall, we require a type or equivalent structure. **Not covered.**\n\n3. **\"featureName\" attribute in SafetyFeature.**  \n   - **Not covered.** No explicit \"featureName\" attribute in the generated model.\n\n4. **\"mandatory\" attribute in SafetyFeature.**  \n   - **Covered.** The annotation \"@Safety\" has \"isMandatory : Boolean\", which is semantically equivalent.\n\n5. **Type \"AntiTheftFeature\" exists.**  \n   - **Not covered.** No such type; instead, the model uses \"@Security\" annotation.\n\n6. **\"featureName\" attribute in AntiTheftFeature.**  \n   - **Not covered.**\n\n7. **Type \"BothFeature\" exists.**  \n   - **Not covered.** No such type.\n\n8. **\"featureName\" attribute in BothFeature.**  \n   - **Not covered.**\n\n9. **Block \"Vehicle\" exists.**  \n   - **Covered.** The generated model has a \"part vehicle\" in the \"PartsTree\" package, which is equivalent.\n\n10. **Attribute \"name\" = \"Vehicle\" in Vehicle block.**  \n    - **Covered.** The part is named \"vehicle\", which is equivalent.\n\n11. **Attribute \"safetyComponents\" : Set(SafetyFeature).**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model has parts (e.g., seatBelt, driverAirBag, bumper, antilockBrakes) annotated with @Safety, which can be considered as safety components. The structure is not exactly the same (no explicit \"safetyComponents\" attribute), but the semantic grouping is present. **Covered.**\n\n12. **Attribute \"antiTheftComponents\" : Set(AntiTheftFeature).**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model has parts annotated with @Security (e.g., alarm, keylessEntry), which are anti-theft components. Again, not an explicit attribute, but the grouping is present. **Covered.**\n\n13. **Attribute \"bothComponents\" : Set(BothFeature).**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model has a package 'Safety & Security Features' that groups parts with either @Safety or @Security. This is a semantic match. **Covered.**\n\n14. **Instance \"frontSeatBelts\" of type SafetyFeature.**  \n    - **Covered.** The generated model has \"seatBelt[2]\" part annotated with @Safety{isMandatory = true;}, which matches \"frontSeatBelts\" as a safety feature.\n\n15. **\"featureName\" = \"Front Seat Belts\" in frontSeatBelts.**  \n    - **Not covered.** The generated model does not specify feature names as attributes.\n\n16. **\"mandatory\" = true in frontSeatBelts.**  \n    - **Covered.** \"seatBelt[2]\" is annotated with @Safety{isMandatory = true;}.\n\n17. **Instance \"bumpers\" of type SafetyFeature.**  \n    - **Covered.** The generated model has \"bumper\" part annotated with @Safety{isMandatory = true;}.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Covered: 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 (9 claims)\n- Total claims: 17\n\n**Score: 9/17**"

However, it does not define a `Vehicle` type with all four mass attributes as in the reference model. **Not fully covered.**\n\n#### Blocks\n\n3. **Definition of block `chassis` of type `Vehicle` with attribute `Mass chassisMass`.**\n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model does not define a separate `chassis` part/block; it only has `chassisMass` as an attribute of `Vehicle`. **Not covered as a separate block.**\n\n4. **Definition of block `engine` of type `Vehicle` with attribute `Mass engineMass`.**\n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model defines an `engine` part inside `Vehicle` with a `mass` attribute, but not as a block of type `Vehicle` with `engineMass`. **Not fully covered.**\n\n5. **Definition of block `transmission` of type `Vehicle` with attribute `Mass transmissionMass`.**\n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model defines a `transmission` part (though as type `Engine`, which may be a typo), with a `mass` attribute, but not as a block of type `Vehicle` with `transmissionMass`. **Not fully covered.**\n\n6. **Definition of block `system` of type `Vehicle` with attribute `Mass totalMass`.**\n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model's `Vehicle` part has a `massConstraint` and `chassisMass`, but not a `totalMass` attribute or a `system` block. **Not covered.**\n\n#### Operation in system block\n\n7. **Definition of operation `checkMass` in `system` block.**\n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model defines a constraint (`MassConstraint`) that checks the sum of masses, which is similar in intent, but not an operation in a block. **Partially covered.**\n\n8. **`checkMass` has input `chassis` of type `Chassis`.**\n   - **Not covered.** The generated model does not define an operation with this input.\n\n9. **`checkMass` has input `engine` of type `Engine`.**\n   - **Not covered.**\n\n10. **`checkMass` has input `transmission` of type `Transmission`.**\n    - **Not covered.**\n\n11. **`checkMass` has precondition: `self.totalMass.value <= 2500`.**\n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model's constraint enforces `sum(partMasses) <= massLimit`, which is semantically similar. **Covered.**\n\n12. **`checkMass` has effect: `self.totalMass.value = chassis.chassisMass.value + engine.engineMass.value + transmission.transmissionMass.value`.**\n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model's constraint uses `sum(partMasses)`, which is equivalent. **Covered.**\n\n#### Connections\n\n13. **Declaration of a connection/instance: `Chassis chassis`.**\n    - **Not covered.** The generated model does not declare a separate `Chassis` part.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Vehicle Properties**\n3. **`Vehicle` has a property `totalMassFueled` of type `Integer`.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model has `fuelFullMass: MassValue`, which is semantically equivalent to `totalMassFueled`, but the type is `MassValue` instead of `Integer`. Since types can be considered equivalent if they represent mass, **covered**.\n4. **`totalMassFueled` has an initial value of 2000.**  \n   - **Covered.** The requirement `fullVehicleMassLimit` sets `massReqd = 2000[kg]`, and the constraint `vehicle.fuelMass == vehicle.fuelFullMass` implies full fuel. The sum of `dryMass + fuelMass` is set to be ≤ 2000kg, which matches the intent.\n5. **`totalMassFueled` has a lower bound of 2000.**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model only sets an upper bound (≤ 2000kg), not a lower bound.\n6. **`totalMassFueled` has an upper bound of 2000.**  \n   - **Covered.** The requirement enforces `massActual <= massReqd` with `massReqd = 2000kg`.\n7. **`Vehicle` has a property `totalMassEmpty` of type `Integer`.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model uses `dryMass` and sets `fuelMass == 0` for the empty case, and the requirement `emptyVehicleMassLimit` sets `massReqd = 1500kg`.

Clutch Interface**\n14. **`Engine` contains an Interface named `ClutchInterface`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model defines a `ClutchPort` and a requirement `DrivePowerInterface` that refers to the clutch, and `Engine` has a `clutchPort`. The interface is present as a port and requirement, so **covered**.\n15. **`ClutchInterface` has an Operation named `transmitTorque`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The requirement `DrivePowerInterface` states that the engine shall transfer its generated torque to the transmission via the clutch interface, which is semantically equivalent. **Covered.**\n16. **`transmitTorque` has a precondition: `Engine.torque > 0`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The requirement `VehicleMassLimitationRequirement` has an assumption `vehicle.fuelMass > 0[kg]`, but there is no explicit precondition on torque. **Not covered.**\n\n---\n\n### 3.
