Definition of port type `FuelPort` with an outgoing item `fuel` of type `Fuel`.\n- **Reference:** Reference model uses `flowPort fuelOut;` etc., but does not define a port type. **Not supported** (no explicit port type).\n\n#### 3. Definition of part `Pump` with:\n   - port `fuelInPort` of type `~FuelPort` (in port)\n   - port `fuelOutPort` of type `FuelPort` (out port)\n- **Reference:** `FuelPump` has `flowPort fuelIn;` and `flowPort fuelOut;`. **Supported** (structure matches).\n\n#### 4.

There is a package named VehicleManagementSystem.\n- **Not covered.** The generated model uses a different package name ('5-State-based Behavior-1'), but this is a naming difference. However, the structure is not named the same, but per instructions, naming differences can be ignored if the structure is equivalent. The generated model is a top-level package containing the relevant elements, so **covered**.\n\n#### 2. There is a part named VehicleA.\n- **Covered.** `part def VehicleA` in Definitions.\n\n#### 3. There is a block named VehicleController.\n- **Covered.** `part def VehicleController` in Definitions.\n\n#### 4. There is a block named System.\n- **Not covered.** There is no explicit `System` block or equivalent composite block in the generated model. The structure is distributed among packages and parts, but no explicit System block.\n\n#### 5. System has a state named Off.\n- **Covered.** In 'vehicle states' > 'operational states' > `state off;`.\n\n#### 6. System has a state named Starting.\n- **Covered.** In 'vehicle states' > 'operational states' > `state starting;`.\n\n#### 7. System has a state named Running.\n- **Covered.** In 'vehicle states' > 'operational states' > `state on;` (assuming 'on' is equivalent to 'Running').\n\n#### 8. System has a state named HealthManagement.\n- **Covered.** In 'vehicle states' > 'health states' > `state normal;` and `state degraded;` and `state maintenance;` (but no explicit 'HealthManagement' state). However, 'health states' is a composite state, and 'normal' likely corresponds to 'HealthManagement'. This is a partial match, but not exact. Let's be strict: **Not covered**.\n\n#### 9. System has a state named Maintenance.\n- **Covered.** In 'vehicle states' > 'health states' > `state maintenance;`.\n\n#### 10. System has a state named Degraded.\n- **Covered.** In 'vehicle states' > 'health states' > `state degraded;`.\n\n#### 11. There is a transition OffToStarting: Off -> Starting, triggered by startSignal, guarded by brakePressed.\n- **Covered.** In 'operational states':  \n  `transition 'off-starting' first off accept 'Vehicle Start Signal' if vehicle1_c1.'brake pedal depressed' ... then starting;`  \n  (startSignal = 'Vehicle Start Signal', guard = 'brake pedal depressed')\n\n#### 12. There is a transition StartingToRunning: Starting -> Running, triggered by vehicleOnSignal.\n- **Covered.**  \n  `transition 'starting-on' first starting accept 'Vehicle On Signal' then on;`  \n  ('on' = 'Running')\n\n#### 13. There is a transition RunningToHealthManagement: Running -> HealthManagement, triggered by exitRunning.\n- **Not covered.** There is no transition from 'on' to 'health states' or 'normal' triggered by 'exitRunning' or equivalent.\n\n#### 14. There is a transition HealthManagementToDegraded: HealthManagement -> Degraded, triggered by temperatureExceedsThreshold.\n- **Covered.**  \n  In 'health states':  \n  `transition 'normal-degraded' first normal accept when 'sense temperature'.temp > vehicle1_c1.Tmax do send 'Over Temp'() ... then degraded;`  \n  ('normal' = 'HealthManagement', 'degraded' = 'Degraded', trigger is over-temperature condition, which is equivalent to 'temperatureExceedsThreshold')\n\n#### 15. There is a transition DegradedToMaintenance: Degraded -> Maintenance, triggered by overTemperatureSignal.\n- **Not covered.** There is no transition from 'degraded' to 'maintenance' in the generated model.\n\n#### 16. There is a transition MaintenanceToNormal: Maintenance -> Running, triggered by restoreToNormalSignal.\n- **Covered.**  \n  `transition 'maintenance-normal' first maintenance accept 'Return to Normal' then normal;`  \n  ('normal' is the healthy state, equivalent to 'Running' in the reference model's context)\n\n#### 17. There is a flow named temperature.\n- **Covered.**  \n  'Sense Temperature' action with output 'temp', and attribute 'Tmax: TemperatureValue'.\n\n#### 18. There is a flow named startSignal.\n- **Covered.**  \n  Attribute 'Start Signal', and 'Vehicle Start Signal' used in transitions.\n\n#### 19. There is a flow named vehicleOnSignal.\n- **Covered.**  \n  Attribute 'Vehicle On Signal', used in transitions.\n\n#### 20. There is a flow named exitRunning.\n- **Not covered.** No 'exitRunning' flow or equivalent in the generated model.\n\n#### 21. There is a flow named temperatureExceedsThreshold.\n- **Covered.**  \n  The transition 'normal-degraded' is triggered by 'sense temperature'.temp > Tmax, which is equivalent.\n\n#### 22. There is a flow named overTemperature.\n- **Covered.**  \n  Attribute 'Over Temp', and 'do send Over Temp()' in transition.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The package imports ISQ::*.\n\n### 2. Part Definitions\n5.

There is a part definition 'Road' with:\n   - attribute angle : Real\n   - attribute surfaceFriction : Real\n\n### 3. Individual Definitions\n9. There is an individual 'Temporal-Spatial Reference_ID1' of type 'Temporal-Spatial Reference'.\n10. There is an individual 'VehicleRoadContext_ID1' of type 'VehicleRoadContext'.\n11. There is an individual 'VehicleA_ID1' of type 'VehicleA'.\n12. There is an individual 'Road_ID1' of type 'Road'.\n\n### 4. Values\n13. There are attributes t0, t1, tn : TimeValue.\n14. There are attributes m : MassValue.\n15. There are attributes p0, p1, pn : Real.\n16. There are attributes v0, v1, vn : Real.\n17. There are attributes a0, a1, an : Real.\n18. There are attributes theta0, theta1, thetan : Real.\n19. There are attributes sf0, sf1, sfn : Real.\n\n### 5. Individuals and Snapshots\n20. There is an individual 'reference' of type 'Temporal-Spatial Reference_ID1' with:\n    - snapshot context_t0 : VehicleRoadContext_ID1 with t = t0, containing:\n      - snapshot vehicle_ID1_t0 : VehicleA_ID1 with mass = m, position = p0, velocity = v0, acceleration = a0, vehicleStates.on\n      - snapshot road_ID1_t0 : Road_ID1 with angle = theta0, surfaceFriction = sf0\n    - snapshot context_t1 : VehicleRoadContext_ID1 with t = t1, containing:\n      - snapshot vehicle_ID1_t1 : VehicleA_ID1 with mass = m, position = p1, velocity = v1, acceleration = a1, vehicleStates.on\n      - snapshot road_ID1_t1 : Road_ID1 with angle = theta1, surfaceFriction = sf1\n    - snapshot context_tn : VehicleRoadContext_ID1 with t = tn, containing:\n      - snapshot vehicle_ID1_tn : VehicleA_ID1 with mass = m, position = pn, velocity = vn, acceleration = an, vehicleStates.off\n      - snapshot road_ID1_tn : Road_ID1 with angle = theta1, surfaceFriction = sfn\n\nLet's break down the snapshot claims into atomic elements:\n\n#### For each snapshot (t0, t1, tn):\n- The context snapshot contains a time value (t = t0, t1, tn).\n- The vehicle snapshot contains mass, position, velocity, acceleration, and a state (on/off).\n- The road snapshot contains angle and surfaceFriction.\n\nSo, for each of the three time points, the following claims are made:\n- context_t* : VehicleRoadContext_ID1 with t = t*\n- vehicle_ID1_t* : VehicleA_ID1 with mass, position, velocity, acceleration, vehicleStates state\n- road_ID1_t* : Road_ID1 with angle, surfaceFriction\n\nFor t0: 1 (context) + 5 (vehicle) + 2 (road) = 8 claims  \nFor t1: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8  \nFor tn: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8  \nTotal: 24 claims\n\nBut since the attributes (mass, position, etc.) are already claimed as part of the part definitions, the snapshot claims are about the assignment of values at different time points.\n\nLet's count the snapshot claims as follows:\n- For each snapshot, the assignment of each attribute is an atomic claim.\n\nFor t0:\n- context_t0: t = t0 (1)\n- vehicle_ID1_t0: mass = m, position = p0, velocity = v0, acceleration = a0, vehicleStates.on (5)\n- road_ID1_t0: angle = theta0, surfaceFriction = sf0 (2)\nTotal for t0: 8\n\nFor t1:\n- context_t1: t = t1 (1)\n- vehicle_ID1_t1: mass = m, position = p1, velocity = v1, acceleration = a1, vehicleStates.on (5)\n- road_ID1_t1: angle = theta1, surfaceFriction = sf1 (2)\nTotal for t1: 8\n\nFor tn:\n- context_tn: t = tn (1)\n- vehicle_ID1_tn: mass = m, position = pn, velocity = vn, acceleration = an, vehicleStates.off (5)\n- road_ID1_tn: angle = theta1, surfaceFriction = sfn (2)\nTotal for tn: 8\n\nSo, 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 snapshot assignment claims.\n\n### 6.

Package and Imports\n1. Package exists, but name is different. (Not supported)\n2. Import ScalarValues::Real. (Not present in reference; ignore)\n3. Import Time::DateTime. (Not present in reference; ignore)\n4. Import ISQ::*. (Not present in reference; ignore)\n\n**Supported: 0/4** (But these are not core modeling elements, so can be ignored for precision.)\n\n#### 2.

State Machine\n- VehicleA has state machine 'vehicleStates' with 'on' and 'off': Not present in reference. **(0/1)**\n\n#### 4. Individual Definitions\n- Individuals: Not present in reference model (reference does not define individuals). **(0/4)**\n\n#### 5.

The reference model does not define value instances, so **(0/19)**.\n\n#### 6. Snapshot Assignments\n- context_t*: t = t*: Not present in reference.\n- vehicle_ID1_t*: mass, position, velocity, acceleration assignments: The reference model defines these as parameters, but does not define snapshots or value assignments.\n- vehicleStates.on/off: Not present in reference.\n- road_ID1_t*: angle, surfaceFriction assignments: Reference model defines slope and frictionCoefficient as parameters, but not as value assignments.\n\nSince the reference model does not define snapshots or value assignments, **(0/24)**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nLet's sum up the supported claims:\n\n- VehicleA attributes: 4\n- Road attributes: 2\n\n**Total supported claims: 6**\n\n**Total claims in generated model: 61**\n\n---\n\n**Score: 6/61**",

This is a structural difference. In the reference, it's ambiguous whether steeringAngle is on the assembly or the axle. The description says \"The front axle has properties for mass and steering angle,\" suggesting the attribute should be on FrontAxle, not FrontAxleAssembly.

The `TorqueGeneratorFunctionAllocation` block has a property `allocatedFunction` referencing `TorqueGenerator::torqueGenerationFunction`.\n10. The `TorqueGeneratorFunctionAllocation` block has a property `allocatedItem` referencing `PowertrainSystem`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a package named `TorqueGenerationSystem`.\n- **Generated model:** The top-level package is named `PowertrainFunctionComponentAllocation`, not `TorqueGenerationSystem`.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered** (package name is different and not nested).\n\n#### 2. There is a part named `PowertrainSystem` in the package.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part definition `PowerTrain` in `PhysicalModel`, and an instance `powerTrain : PowerTrain`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (naming difference, but clear semantic match).\n\n#### 3. There is a block named `TorqueGenerator` in the package.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part definition `TorqueGenerator` in `LogicalModel`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n#### 4. The `TorqueGenerator` block has a property `torqueGenerationFunction` of type `Requirement` (multiplicity [1..1]).\n- **Generated model:** The requirement is defined in `RequirementModel` as `torqueGeneration` with subject `generator: TorqueGenerator`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (structure is different, but the requirement is associated with the generator).\n\n#### 5. The `torqueGenerationFunction` requirement has the text: \"The torque produced during operation must be greater than zero newton-meters to ensure driving capability.\"\n- **Generated model:** The requirement `torqueGeneration` has a constraint: `generator.generateTorque.torque > 0.0 [N*m]`, which is semantically equivalent.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n#### 6. The `TorqueGenerator` block has a property `component` of type `Component` (multiplicity [1..*]).\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit `component` property of type `Component` in `TorqueGenerator`.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered**.\n\n#### 7. The `component` property has an `allocation` to `TorqueGeneratorFunctionAllocation`.\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit property or allocation from a `component` property to an allocation block.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered**.\n\n#### 8. There is a block named `TorqueGeneratorFunctionAllocation`.\n- **Generated model:** There is no block with this name, but there is an allocation definition `LogicalToPhysical` and an instance `torqueGenAlloc`.\n- **Coverage:** **Partially covered** (allocation is present, but not with the same name or structure). For strictness, **Not covered**.\n\n#### 9. The `TorqueGeneratorFunctionAllocation` block has a property `allocatedFunction` referencing `TorqueGenerator::torqueGenerationFunction`.\n- **Generated model:** The allocation `torqueGenAlloc` allocates `torqueGenerator.generateTorque` to `powerTrain.engine.generateTorque`, which is similar to allocating a function to a physical element.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (semantically equivalent).\n\n#### 10. The `TorqueGeneratorFunctionAllocation` block has a property `allocatedItem` referencing `PowertrainSystem`.\n- **Generated model:** The allocation maps to `powerTrain`, which is the equivalent of `PowertrainSystem`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The \"Tire\" block has an attribute \"installationPosition\" of type Vector[3].\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.**\n\n1. **Package named \"TireInformation\":**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model uses a package named \"StructuredDataTypes\".\n\n2. **Block named \"Tire\":**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model defines \"TireInfo\" (not \"Tire\"), but if we allow for naming differences, \"TireInfo\" could be considered equivalent to \"Tire\" as the main tire data structure. **(Covered, if naming differences are ignored.)**\n\n3. **Attribute \"manufacturerName\" of type String:**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model has \"manufacturer: String\" in \"TireInfo\". The name is \"manufacturer\" instead of \"manufacturerName\", but the type and intent are the same. **(Covered, if naming differences are ignored.)**\n\n4. **Attribute \"rimDiameter\" of type Real:**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model has \"hubDiameter: LengthValue\", where \"LengthValue :> Real\". The name is different (\"hubDiameter\" vs \"rimDiameter\"), but the type is compatible, and the intent is similar (diameter of the rim/hub). **(Covered, if naming differences are ignored.)**\n\n5. **Attribute \"tireWidth\" of type Real:**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model has \"width: Integer\" in \"TireInfo\". The name is similar, but the type is \"Integer\" instead of \"Real\". This is a type mismatch, but the attribute is present. **(Partially covered, but not exact; for strict recall, this is not covered due to type mismatch.)**\n\n6. **Attribute \"installationPosition\" of type Vector[3]:**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model has \"placement: PositionVector[0..1]\", where \"PositionVector\" is defined as having x, y, z: Real[1]. This is semantically equivalent to a Vector[3] of Real. The multiplicity is [0..1] instead of exactly 1, but the structure is equivalent. **(Covered, if multiplicity difference is ignored.)**\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's decide on the strictness of coverage:\n\n- For recall, we typically allow for naming differences if the semantics match.\n- For type mismatches, if the type is more restrictive (Integer instead of Real), it is not fully covered.\n- For multiplicity, if the structure is present, we can consider it covered.\n\n**Final coverage:**\n\n1. Package name: **Not covered** (different package name)\n2. Block name: **Covered** (allowing naming difference)\n3. manufacturerName: **Covered** (allowing naming difference)\n4. rimDiameter: **Covered** (allowing naming difference)\n5. tireWidth: **Not covered** (type mismatch: Integer vs Real)\n6. installationPosition: **Covered** (allowing for structure/multiplicity difference)\n\n**Score: 4/6**\n\n---\n\n**Output:**\n\nScore: 4/6"

Summarize the results\n\nNow, let's count the number of claims that are covered (fully or equivalently):\n\n- Claims 6, 7, 8: The signals are present as attributes, but not as parts of VehicleController. **Partial, but let's count as covered for recall if the concept is present.**\n- Claim 10: The state is present as a state machine, not as an attribute. **Partial, but concept is present.**\n- Claim 11: The state values are similar but not identical. **Partial, but concept is present.**\n- Claims 14, 15: The transitions are present as state machine transitions, but not with the same structure. **Partial, but concept is present.**\n\nSo, claims 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15 are covered in a broad sense (7 claims).\n\nTotal claims: 15\n\n**Score: 7/15**"

There is a part type named `Vehicle`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part named `car` of type `CarPart`, which is a subtype of `compositeThing` and `MassedThing`. The role of `Vehicle` is played by `car`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (naming is different, but the structure and semantics match).\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has a required attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `MassedThing` (supertype of `car`) has `simpleMass :> ISQ::mass`, which is a mass attribute. `ISQ::mass` is a physical quantity, equivalent to `Real` in this context.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle` has a (0..*) association end `component` to `Component`.\n- **Generated model:** `car` has `carParts: CarPart[*]`, which is mapped to `subcomponents` in `compositeThing`, which is a collection of `MassedThing`.

There is a part type named `Engine` that extends `Component`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part `engine` in `car`, of type `simpleThing` (which extends `MassedThing`), and is also a `carPart`. However, there is no explicit type named `Engine` that extends `Component`.\n- **Coverage:** **Not covered** (no explicit type definition for `Engine` as a subtype of `Component`).\n\n#### 9.

Block and Part Structure**\n1. **Block `Vehicle`**  \n   - **Covered**: There is a `Vehicle` in the generated model.\n2. **`Vehicle` has a part `Weight`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: The generated model has an attribute `mass` directly on `Vehicle`, not a part `Weight`.\n3. **`Weight` has an attribute `curbWeight`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No `Weight` part, so no `curbWeight` attribute.\n4. **`curbWeight` is of type `Real`**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: The generated model uses `mass :> ISQ::mass`, which is a physical quantity (mass), not a plain `Real`. Not equivalent.\n5. **`curbWeight` has a range: interval[0..2500]**  \n   - **Covered**: The requirement in the generated model enforces `mass <= 2500 kg`.\n\n**B. System Structure**\n6. **Block `VehicleQualityCheckSystem`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No such block; the generated model uses `VehicleMassTest` as a verification definition.\n7. **`VehicleQualityCheckSystem` has a part `DataCollection`**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: There is an action `collectData` in the generated model, which serves a similar purpose.\n8. **`DataCollection` has an operation `collectWeightData(v: Vehicle): Real`**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: `collectData` action takes a `Vehicle` and outputs `massMeasured`, which is similar.\n9. **`VehicleQualityCheckSystem` has a part `DataProcessing`**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: There is an action `processData`.\n10. **`DataProcessing` has an operation `processWeightData(data: Real): Real`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: `processData` takes `massMeasured` and outputs `massProcessed`.\n11. **`VehicleQualityCheckSystem` has a part `Evaluation`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: There is an action `evaluateData`.\n12. **`Evaluation` has an operation `evaluateWeight(processedData: Real): Boolean`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: `evaluateData` takes `massProcessed` and outputs `verdict : VerdictKind` (Boolean-like).\n\n**C. Flows**\n13. **Flow `collectWeightDataFlow` from `DataCollection` to `DataProcessing`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: The output of `collectData` is input to `processData`.\n14. **Flow `processWeightDataFlow` from `DataCollection` to `Evaluation`**  \n    - **Not Covered**: In the generated model, data flows from `collectData` to `processData` to `evaluateData`, not directly from `collectData` to `evaluateData`.\n15. **Flow `evaluateWeightFlow` from `Evaluation` to `VehicleQualityCheckSystem`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: The result of `evaluateData` is returned as `verdict` from `VehicleMassTest`.\n\n**D. Requirement**\n16. **Requirement `VehicleWeightRequirement`**  \n    - **Covered**: There is a requirement `vehicleMassRequirement` with the same intent.\n17. **Requirement text: \"The curb weight of each vehicle must be less than or equal to 2,500 kilograms\"**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model's requirement expresses the same constraint.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.\n\n**Claim 1:** There is a package named 'EngineConfigurationVariants'.  \n- **Not supported.** The reference model's package is 'EngineSystem', but naming differences are to be ignored if the structure matches. However, the package name itself is not a structural element, so this is not a meaningful modeling claim for precision.\n\n**Claim 2:** There is an attribute definition 'Diameter' of type ISQ::LengthValue.  \n- **Partially supported.** The reference model defines an attribute 'diameter' in Cylinder, with allowed values {70, 100}, but does not define a separate 'Diameter' type. The use of a type for diameter is a modeling difference, but the attribute itself is present. However, the explicit type 'ISQ::LengthValue' is not in the reference.\n\n**Claim 3:** There is a part definition 'Cylinder' with an attribute 'diameter' of type 'Diameter' and multiplicity [1].  \n- **Supported.** The reference model defines block Cylinder with attribute diameter. The type is not explicitly defined, but the attribute and its presence are supported.\n\n**Claim 4:** There is a part definition 'Engine' with a part 'cylinder' of type 'Cylinder' and multiplicity [2..*].  \n- **Not supported.** The reference model defines Engine with part[0..1] Cylinder and a constraint that the number of Cylinders is 4 or 6. The generated model allows 2 or more Cylinders, which is not equivalent.\n\n**Claim 5:** There is a part '4cylEngine' of type 'Engine' with a part that redefines 'cylinder' with multiplicity [4].  \n- **Supported.** The reference model defines block FourCylinderEngine with part[4] Cylinder, which is equivalent.\n\n**Claim 6:** There is a part '6cylEngine' of type 'Engine' with a part that redefines 'cylinder' with multiplicity [6].  \n- **Supported.** The reference model defines block SixCylinderEngine with part[6] Cylinder, which is equivalent.\n\n**Claim 7:** There is a variation attribute definition 'DiameterChoices' of type 'Diameter' with two variants: 'diameterSmall' = 70[mm] and 'diameterLarge' = 100[mm].  \n- **Supported.** The reference model defines attribute diameter : {70, 100} in Cylinder, which is equivalent to two allowed values.\n\n**Claim 8:** There is a variation part definition 'EngineChoices' of type 'Engine' with two variants: '4cylEngine' and '6cylEngine'.  \n- **Supported.** The reference model defines usage EngineVariant with part[1] Engine, and blocks FourCylinderEngineVariant and SixCylinderEngineVariant, each with part[1] FourCylinderEngine or SixCylinderEngine. This is equivalent to having two engine variants.\n\n### 3.

We'll consider this as covered for recall, since the structure is equivalent.\n\n4. **Battery part has attribute batteryLevel : Real**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model's 'battery' part has an attribute 'power : Real', which could be interpreted as battery level, but the name is different. For recall, if the semantics are equivalent, we count it as covered. Here, 'power' is likely equivalent to 'batteryLevel'. **Covered.**\n\n5. **Battery part has attribute minimumThreshold : Real**  \n   - **Covered.** The generated model has 'minPower : Real' in the DeviceFailure scenario, which is used as a threshold for battery power. This is equivalent.\n\n6. **Battery part has attribute failureProbability : Real**  \n   - **Covered.** The generated model has a 'probability : Real' attribute for the 'Cause' (e.g., 'battery old'), which is used in the scenario. This is equivalent.\n\n7. **Equipment block contains a block named RiskAnalysis**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model does not have a 'RiskAnalysis' block or equivalent.\n\n8. **RiskAnalysis block contains a block named RiskDetection**  \n   - **Not covered.** No explicit 'RiskDetection' block.\n\n9. **RiskDetection block has operation detectBatteryAgingRisk() : Boolean**  \n   - **Not covered.** No explicit operation, though the scenario 'battery old' is modeled as a cause, but not as an operation.\n\n10. **RiskAnalysis block contains a block named StateAnalysis**  \n    - **Not covered.** No explicit 'StateAnalysis' block.\n\n11. **StateAnalysis block has operation analyzeLowBatteryState() : Boolean**  \n    - **Not covered.** No explicit operation.\n\n12. **RiskAnalysis block contains a block named FailureConsequence**  \n    - **Not covered.** No explicit 'FailureConsequence' block.\n\n13. **FailureConsequence block has operation handleDeviceShutdown() : Boolean**  \n    - **Not covered.** No explicit operation, though 'device shutoff' is modeled as a failure, but not as an operation.\n\n14. **Equipment block contains a block named SeverityLevel**  \n    - **Not covered.** The generated model has a 'Level' and 'LevelEnum' imported, and 'severity' is used as an attribute of 'Failure', but there is no explicit 'SeverityLevel' block.\n\n15. **SeverityLevel block has attribute level : Integer**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model's 'Failure' has 'severity : Level', and 'LevelEnum' is used (likely an enumeration), but not an Integer attribute named 'level'. Not equivalent.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Claim 3: Covered (Device.battery equivalent to Equipment.Battery)\n- Claim 4: Covered (battery.power ≈ batteryLevel)\n- Claim 5: Covered (minPower ≈ minimumThreshold)\n- Claim 6: Covered (probability ≈ failureProbability)\n\nTotal covered: **4**\n\nTotal claims: **15**\n\n**Score: 4/15**"

This is a reasonable mapping to the interface and flow structure, even if not named identically. So, for recall, let's count these as covered if the structure and semantics match.\n\nSo, let's check:\n\n- **Claim 11:** Flow `FuelFlow` is defined.  \n  - There is no explicit flow definition, but the port structure with `fuelSupply` (out) and `fuelReturn` (in) models the same concept. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 12:** `FuelFlow` has source `FuelTank`.  \n  - `FuelTank` has a port with `fuelSupply` as out. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 13:** `FuelFlow` has target `Engine`.  \n  - `Engine` has a conjugated port, which would receive `fuelSupply`. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 14:** Flow `FuelReturn` is defined.  \n  - The port has `fuelReturn` as in. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 15:** `FuelReturn` has source `Engine`.  \n  - `Engine`'s conjugated port would output `fuelReturn`. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 16:** `FuelReturn` has target `FuelTank`.  \n  - `FuelTank`'s port would receive `fuelReturn`. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 17:** Interface `FuelInterface` is defined.  \n  - `FuelPort` serves as an interface. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 18:** `FuelInterface` has end `FuelTank`.  \n  - `FuelTank` uses `FuelPort`. **Covered.**\n\n- **Claim 19:** `FuelInterface` has end `Engine`.  \n  - `Engine` uses conjugated `FuelPort`. **Covered.**\n\nAll other claims are not covered.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
