For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1. There is a package 'VehicleType'.\n- **Supported**: Yes, the reference model has a package 'VehicleType'.\n\n#### 2. There is an abstract part definition 'Vehicle'.\n- **Supported**: Partially. The reference model defines a class 'Vehicle', but not as abstract, and not in 'VehicleType' (it's in 'Vehicle'). The generated model places 'Vehicle' in 'VehicleType' and makes it abstract. **Not supported** (wrong package and abstraction).\n\n#### 3. There is a part definition 'HumanDrivenVehicle' that specializes 'Vehicle'.\n- **Supported**: The reference model has 'ManuallyOperatedVehicle' in 'VehicleType', which is conceptually similar to 'HumanDrivenVehicle', but the name is different. If we ignore naming differences as per instructions, this is **Supported**.\n\n#### 4. 'HumanDrivenVehicle' has a reference part 'driver' of type 'Person'.\n- **Supported**: The reference model's 'Vehicle' has an attribute 'driver : Personnel', but 'ManuallyOperatedVehicle' does not. The generated model puts 'driver' in 'HumanDrivenVehicle', which is not present in the reference model's 'ManuallyOperatedVehicle'. Also, 'Person' vs 'Personnel' (ignore naming). **Not supported** (wrong class).\n\n#### 5. There is a part definition 'PoweredVehicle' that specializes (':>') 'Vehicle'.\n- **Supported**: The reference model has 'PoweredVehicle' in 'VehicleType', but it does not explicitly state inheritance from 'Vehicle'. However, the context suggests that 'PoweredVehicle' is a kind of 'Vehicle'. **Supported**.\n\n#### 6. 'PoweredVehicle' has a part 'eng' of type 'Engine'.\n- **Supported**: The reference model's 'Vehicle' has 'powerDevice : Engine', but 'PoweredVehicle' does not have an 'Engine' attribute. The generated model puts 'eng : Engine' in 'PoweredVehicle', which is not present in the reference. **Not supported**.\n\n#### 7. There is a part definition 'HumanDrivenPoweredVehicle' that specializes both 'HumanDrivenVehicle' and 'PoweredVehicle'.\n- **Supported**: The reference model has 'ManuallyOperatedPoweredVehicle' in 'VehicleType', which is conceptually the same as 'HumanDrivenPoweredVehicle' specializing both 'ManuallyOperatedVehicle' and 'PoweredVehicle'. **Supported**.\n\n#### 8. There is a part definition 'Engine'.\n- **Supported**: The reference model has a class 'Engine' in 'Entity'. **Supported**.\n\n#### 9. There is a part definition 'Person'.\n- **Supported**: The reference model has a class 'Personnel' in 'Entity'. If we ignore naming, **Supported**.\n\n### 3.

Class `TorqueAmplification` → covered by action `'Amplify Torque'`\n- 9. Class `TorqueTransmission` → covered by action `'Transfer Torque'`\n- 11. Class `TorqueDistribution` → covered by action `'Distribute Torque'`\n- 6. Property `generate_torque : Boolean` in `EngineStartControl` → covered by action `'Generate Torque'`\n- 17. Property `generate_torque : Boolean` in `Engine` → covered by action `'Generate Torque'`\n\nBut, since the instructions say \"the same or equivalent element\", and \"ignore formatting or identifier naming differences if the structure and semantics match\", we can count these as covered if we accept actions as equivalent to classes representing functional blocks.\n\n#### So, covered claims:\n\n- 6. `generate_torque` (as action)\n- 7. `TorqueAmplification` (as action)\n- 9. `TorqueTransmission` (as action)\n- 11. `TorqueDistribution` (as action)\n- 17. `generate_torque` (as action)\n\nThat's 5 claims.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a package named `VehicleMassComplianceSystem`.\n- **Not covered.** The generated model's top-level package is `VehicleMassComplianceVerification`.\n\n#### 2. There is a block (system) named `VehicleMassComplianceSystem`.\n- **Partially covered.** There is a `MassVerificationSystem` part, which is analogous, but the name is different. For recall, this is considered covered if the structure matches, so **covered**.\n\n#### 3. The block has a property `ActualMass` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered.** In the generated model, `massActual : ISQ::mass` in `MassRequirement` and `mass : ISQ::mass` in `Vehicle` correspond to `ActualMass`. The type is more specific (with units), but semantically matches.\n\n#### 4. The block has a property `MaxPermissibleMass` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered.** `massReqd : ISQ::mass` in `MassRequirement` corresponds to `MaxPermissibleMass`.\n\n#### 5. The block has a property `Vehicle` of type `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered.** There is a `Vehicle` part, and the system contains a reference to a `Vehicle` (`vehicleUnderTest`).\n\n#### 6. The block has a property `TestOperator` of type `TestOperator`.\n- **Covered.** There is a `TestOperator` part in the system.\n\n#### 7. The block has a property `WeighingEquipment` of type `WeighingEquipment`.\n- **Covered.** There is a `Scale` part, which is the weighing equipment.\n\n#### 8. The block defines an operation `IsCompliant` returning `Boolean`, with precondition `ActualMass <= MaxPermissibleMass` and postcondition `result = true`.\n- **Covered.** The `MassRequirement` constraint `massActual <= massReqd` and the evaluation logic in `evaluateData` (with a verdict) correspond to this operation.\n\n#### 9. The block defines an operation `DetermineCompliance` returning `Boolean`, with precondition `ActualMass <= MaxPermissibleMass` and postcondition `result = true`.\n- **Covered.** This is functionally the same as `IsCompliant`, and the generated model covers this via the same requirement and verification logic.\n\n#### 10. The block defines an operation `TestVehicle` returning `Void`, with precondition `Vehicle != null` and postcondition `Vehicle.ActualMass = WeighingEquipment.MeasureMass()`.\n- **Covered.** The `collectData` action in the generated model measures the vehicle's mass using the scale, corresponding to this operation.\n\n#### 11. The block defines an operation `CompareMass` returning `Void`, with precondition `Vehicle != null` and postcondition `Vehicle.ActualMass = WeighingEquipment.MeasureMass()`.\n- **Covered.** Same as above; the generated model's data collection and processing actions cover this.\n\n#### 12. The block defines an operation `StartTesting` returning `Void`, with precondition `Vehicle != null` and postcondition `Vehicle.TestStatus = \"Testing\"`.\n- **Not covered.** There is no explicit representation of a `TestStatus` attribute or its change to \"Testing\" in the generated model.\n\n#### 13. The block defines an operation `EndTesting` returning `Void`, with precondition `Vehicle != null` and postcondition `Vehicle.TestStatus = \"Completed\"`.\n- **Not covered.** No explicit `TestStatus` attribute or its change to \"Completed\".\n\n#### 14. The block defines an operation `GetResult` returning `Void`, with precondition `Vehicle != null` and postcondition `Vehicle.TestResult = IsCompliant()`.\n- **Partially covered.** The verdict is returned in the generated model, but there is no explicit `TestResult` attribute on the vehicle. For recall, this is **not covered**.\n\n#### 15. The block defines an operation `GetVehicleStatus` returning `Void`, with precondition `Vehicle != null` and postcondition `Vehicle.TestStatus = \"Completed\"`.\n- **Not covered.** No explicit `TestStatus` attribute or its value.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Let's be generous and count it as covered, since the concept is present.\n- **Claim 34**: `Engine` exists as a part, not as a block. The reference model's `Engine` block is empty, so the presence of an `engine` part is arguably equivalent. Let's count it as covered.\n\n**So, only claims 3 and 34 are covered.**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

There is a class `Vehicle` that is a Block.\n- **Generated model:** `part def Vehicle_1` (serves as the main vehicle class/part).\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 2. `Vehicle` has an attribute `mass` of type `Dimension` with value `1200.0 kg`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute mass: MassValue = 1200 [kg];`\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has an attribute `length` of type `Dimension` with value `4.82 m`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute length: LengthValue = 4.82 [m];`\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle` has an attribute `front_wheels` of type `FrontWheels` with value `FrontWheels()`.\n- **Generated model:** Instead of a `front_wheels` part, the generated model has two parts directly in `Vehicle_1`: `leftFrontWheel` and `rightFrontWheel` of type `Wheel`.\n- **Covered:** **No.** The intermediate `FrontWheels` grouping is missing; the wheels are directly in `Vehicle_1`.\n\n#### 5. There is a class `FrontWheels` that is a Block.\n- **Generated model:** No such class or part.\n- **Covered:** **No.**\n\n#### 6. `FrontWheels` has an attribute `left_front_wheel` of type `FrontWheel` with value `FrontWheel()`.\n- **Generated model:** `Vehicle_1` has `leftFrontWheel : Wheel;` (directly in Vehicle, not in FrontWheels).\n- **Covered:** **Partial.** The left front wheel exists, but not as a part of a `FrontWheels` grouping. For recall, we require the structure to match, so **No**.\n\n#### 7. `FrontWheels` has an attribute `right_front_wheel` of type `FrontWheel` with value `FrontWheel()`.\n- **Generated model:** `Vehicle_1` has `rightFrontWheel : Wheel;` (directly in Vehicle, not in FrontWheels).\n- **Covered:** **Partial.** Same as above, so **No**.\n\n#### 8. There is a class `FrontWheel` that is a Block.\n- **Generated model:** There is a class `Wheel`, but not specifically `FrontWheel`.\n- **Covered:** **Partial.** If we accept `Wheel` as equivalent to `FrontWheel`, then **Yes**. (Assuming the generated model is generalizing the concept.)\n\n#### 9. `FrontWheel` has an attribute `hub_diameter` of type `Dimension` with value `18 in`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute hubDiameter: LengthValue = 18 ['in'];` in `Wheel`.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 10. `FrontWheel` has an attribute `width` of type `Dimension` with value `245 mm`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute width: LengthValue = 245 [mm];` in `Wheel`.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 11. `FrontWheel` has an attribute `outer_diameter` of type `Dimension` with value `18 in`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute outerDiameter: LengthValue = (hubDiameter + 2 * tire.height) [mm] {}` in `Wheel`.\n- **Covered:** **No.** The value and unit do not match: in the reference, `outer_diameter` is a fixed value (`18 in`), but in the generated model, it's a computed value in mm, and depends on a `tire.height` attribute (which is not defined). So, **No**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n1. Vehicle class: **Yes**\n2. Vehicle.mass: **Yes**\n3. Vehicle.length: **Yes**\n4. Vehicle.front_wheels: **No**\n5. FrontWheels class: **No**\n6. FrontWheels.left_front_wheel: **No**\n7. FrontWheels.right_front_wheel: **No**\n8. FrontWheel class: **Yes** (accepting Wheel as equivalent)\n9. FrontWheel.hub_diameter: **Yes**\n10. FrontWheel.width: **Yes**\n11. FrontWheel.outer_diameter: **No**\n\n**Number of covered claims: 6/11**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nScore: 6/11"

There is a subpackage `requirements` inside `cameraSystem`.\n4. Requirement R1 exists with description: \"The system is designed to implement a camera information processing workflow.\"\n5. Requirement R2 exists with description: \"When a user selects a scene through the camera’s viewfinder (viewPort), the system first focuses on the scene to obtain an image (Image).\"\n6. Requirement R2 (second instance, likely meant to be R2 and R2a or R2 and R2b) with description: \"This image is then captured to generate a photograph (Picture).\"\n7. Requirement R3 exists with description: \"After the photograph is generated, the system displays it on the screen via the display port (displayPort).\"\n8.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n**A. Package and Imports**\n1. **Package named `cameraSystem`**: The generated model uses `CameraMessagingSystem` as the package name. This is a naming difference, but the structure is equivalent. **Covered**.\n2. **Imports**: The generated model does not explicitly list imports. Since imports are not part of the core system structure and are often implicit, we can ignore this for recall.\n\n**B. Requirements**\n3. **Subpackage `requirements`**: The generated model does not explicitly define a requirements package or requirements. **Not covered**.\n4. **Requirement R1 (workflow)**: The generated model implements the workflow structurally and behaviorally, but does not explicitly state the requirement. **Not covered** (requirements as explicit elements are missing).\n5. **Requirement R2 (scene selection via viewPort, focus to obtain Image)**: The generated model has a `camera` part with a `viewPort`, and an action `Focus` that takes a `Scene` and outputs an `Image`. The `takePicture` action triggers on a scene via `viewPort` and calls `Focus`. **Covered**.\n6. **Requirement R2 (image captured to generate Picture)**: The generated model has an action `Shoot` that takes an `Image` and outputs a `Picture`, and the `takePicture` action flows from `focus.image` to `shoot.image`. **Covered**.\n7. **Requirement R3 (display Picture on screen via displayPort)**: The generated model has a `screen` part with a `displayPort`, and the `camera` part has a `displayPort`. The `takePicture` action sends `Show(shoot.picture)` via `displayPort`. **Covered**.\n8. **Requirement R4 (user only selects scene and shoots, no technical details)**: The generated model does not explicitly state this requirement, but the user interaction is modeled as \"accept scene via viewPort\" and \"takePicture\" without technical details. **Partially covered** (structurally, but not as an explicit requirement). For recall, since the requirement is not explicitly present, **Not covered**.\n\n**C. Implied Structural/Behavioral Elements**\n9. **Concept of \"scene\" selectable via \"viewPort\"**: The generated model defines `Scene`, and the `camera` part has a `viewPort` port, with the `takePicture` action accepting a `scene` via `viewPort`. **Covered**.\n10. **System can \"focus\" on scene to obtain \"Image\"**: The generated model defines `Focus` action (in: Scene, out: Image). **Covered**.\n11. **System can \"capture\" image to generate \"Picture\"**: The generated model defines `Shoot` action (in: Image, out: Picture). **Covered**.\n12. **\"displayPort\" displays picture on \"screen\"**: The generated model defines a `screen` part with a `displayPort`, and the `Show` attribute (with item `picture: Picture`) is sent via `displayPort`. **Covered**.\n13. **User interacts by selecting scene and shooting**: The generated model models this as \"accept scene via viewPort\" and \"takePicture\". **Covered**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For recall, we can consider them as covered if the elements exist, even if the containment is different, since the instruction says to ignore formatting or identifier naming differences if the structure and semantics match. However, the top-level block is missing, so the structure is not equivalent, but the parts themselves are present.\n\nSo, let's count as covered:\n- Claims 2-6: The parts exist, though not in the same container.

Since the role is similar, but the name and structure differ, and no attributes are present, this is not fully covered.

This is a vehicle analog, but not named \"Vehicle\". However, the structure is equivalent.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 2. `Vehicle` has property `mass` of type `Mass`.\n- **Generated model:** `MassedThing` (supertype of `car`) has `simpleMass :> ISQ::mass` and `totalMass :> ISQ::mass`. This is equivalent to a mass property.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has property `components` of type `Component[]`.\n- **Generated model:** `compositeThing` (which `car` is) has `subcomponents: MassedThing[*]`, and `car` has `carParts: CarPart[*] :>> subcomponents`. This is equivalent.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 4. Definition of block `Component`.\n- **Generated model:** `CarPart` is a part definition, and is a `MassedThing`. This is equivalent.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 5. `Component` has property `mass` of type `Mass`.\n- **Generated model:** `CarPart` inherits from `MassedThing`, which has `simpleMass` and `totalMass`. Equivalent.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 6. Definition of block `Mass`.\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit `Mass` block; instead, mass is represented as a primitive (ISQ::mass). The concept is present, but not as a block.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n#### 7. `Mass` has property `value` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit `Mass` block, so no property `value`. Mass is a primitive.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n#### 8. Definition of block `Engine`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part `engine :> simpleThing, carParts` inside `car`. This is an engine part, but not a block definition; it's a part instance. There is no explicit block definition for `Engine`.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n#### 9. `Engine` has property `mass` of type `Mass`.\n- **Generated model:** The `engine` part is a `simpleThing`, which is a `MassedThing`, which has `simpleMass`. This is equivalent to having a mass property.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 10. Definition of block `Transmission`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part `transmission :> simpleThing, carParts` inside `car`. As with `Engine`, this is a part instance, not a block definition.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n#### 11. `Transmission` has property `mass` of type `Mass`.\n- **Generated model:** The `transmission` part is a `simpleThing`, which is a `MassedThing`, which has `simpleMass`.

We'll consider this **supported**.\n\n5. **MassedThing has an attribute totalMass of type ISQ::mass.**  \n   - **Supported.** Same reasoning as above.\n\n6. **There is a part named simpleThing of type MassedThing.**  \n   - **Supported.** The reference model has `SimpleThing extends Object`, which is equivalent.\n\n7. **simpleThing defines a constraint: totalMass = simpleMass.**  \n   - **Supported.** The reference model's `SimpleThing` has this constraint.\n\n8. **There is a part named compositeThing of type MassedThing.**  \n   - **Supported.** The reference model has `CompositeThing extends Object`, which is equivalent.\n\n9. **compositeThing has a part subcomponents, which is a collection (multiplicity [*]) of MassedThing.**  \n   - **Supported.** The reference model's `CompositeThing` has `attribute subcomponents : Sequence<Object>`. Here, `Object` is the base class, and in the generated model, `MassedThing` is the base. Since both are the base for the hierarchy, this is **supported**.\n\n10. **compositeThing defines a constraint: totalMass = simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass).**  \n    - **Supported.** The reference model's constraint is: `totalMass = simpleMass + subcomponents->iterate(s | s.massAttribute.totalMass)`. The generated model uses `sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`, which is semantically equivalent.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- Supported: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (8 claims)\n- Not supported: 1, 2 (2 claims)\n\n**Score: 8/10**",

The reference model's `Object` is essentially a base class for things with mass attributes. **Equivalent structure present.**  \n  **Covered**\n\n#### 2. `Object` has an attribute `massAttribute` of type `MassAttribute`.\n- **Generated model:** `MassedThing` has two attributes: `simpleMass` and `totalMass`. There is no explicit `massAttribute` attribute of type `MassAttribute`; instead, the attributes are directly on the base part.  \n  **Not covered**\n\n#### 3.

There is a class `SimpleThing` that extends `Object`.\n- **Generated model:** `simpleThing` is a part that is a `MassedThing`. This is equivalent to extending the base class.  \n  **Covered**\n\n#### 7. `SimpleThing` has a constraint: `totalMass = simpleMass`.\n- **Generated model:** `simpleThing` has `attribute :>> totalMass = simpleMass;`  \n  **Covered**\n\n#### 8.

There is an association between `Vehicle` and `Engine` (roles: vehicle, engine).\n\n- **Generated model**: In the part `vehicle_c1`, there is a part `engine_v1: Engine` inside `vehicle_c1: Vehicle`, which is a composition (stronger than association).\n- **Coverage**: **Covered** (composition covers association).\n\n---\n\n### 18.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### **A. Vehicle**\n1. **Class `Vehicle` exists?**  \n   - **Yes.** There is a `part def Vehicle` in the generated model.\n\n2. **Attribute `CurbWeight : Real`?**  \n   - **Partial.** The generated model has `mass : MassValue` and `cargoMass : MassValue`. `CurbWeight` is typically the mass of the vehicle without cargo or passengers. `mass` could correspond to `CurbWeight`, but it's not explicit. Let's be generous and say **covered**.\n\n3. **Attribute `Load : Real`?**  \n   - **Yes.** `cargoMass : MassValue` corresponds to `Load`.\n\n4. **Attribute `WheelDiameter : Real`?**  \n   - **Yes.** `wheelDiameter : LengthValue`.\n\n5. **Attribute `TransmissionEfficiency : Real`?**  \n   - **Yes.** `driveTrainEfficiency : Real`.\n\n6. **Attribute `EnginePower : Real`?**  \n   - **No.** There is no direct attribute for engine power in the `Vehicle` part. There are calculations involving power, but not a static attribute.\n\n7. **Attribute `FuelConsumption : Real`?**  \n   - **No.** There is no direct attribute for fuel consumption in the `Vehicle` part.\n\n8. **Attribute `FuelEconomy : Real`?**  \n   - **Yes.** There are `fuelEconomy_city` and `fuelEconomy_highway` attributes, which are more specific than the reference's general `FuelEconomy`. We'll count this as **covered**.\n\n#### **B. DrivingScenario**\n9. **Class `DrivingScenario` exists?**  \n   - **No.** There is no class named `DrivingScenario`. However, there is a `WayPoint` and scenario attributes in the analysis, which may serve a similar purpose, but not as a class.\n\n10. **Attribute `UrbanDrivingSpeed : Real`?**  \n    - **Partial.** There is a `cityScenario` attribute (a sequence of `WayPoint`s), but not a direct attribute for urban driving speed.\n\n11. **Attribute `HighwayDrivingSpeed : Real`?**  \n    - **Partial.** There is a `highwayScenario` attribute, but not a direct attribute.\n\n12. **Attribute `DrivingTrajectory : String`?**  \n    - **Partial.** The `WayPoint` sequence could encode a trajectory, but not as a string attribute.\n\n13. **Attribute `SpeedVariation : Real`?**  \n    - **Partial.** Speed is present in `WayPoint`, but not as a variation attribute.\n\n#### **C. SimulationAnalysis**\n14. **Class `SimulationAnalysis` exists?**  \n    - **No.** There is an `analysis def FuelEconomyAnalysis`, which is similar in function, but not in name.\n\n15. **Attribute `Vehicle : Vehicle`?**  \n    - **Yes.** `FuelEconomyAnalysis` has `subject vehicle : Vehicle`.\n\n16. **Attribute `DrivingScenario : DrivingScenario`?**  \n    - **Partial.** `FuelEconomyAnalysis` has `in attribute scenario : WayPoint[*]`, which is a sequence of waypoints, not a `DrivingScenario` class.\n\n17. **Attribute `Result : Real`?**  \n    - **Yes.** `FuelEconomyAnalysis` returns `fuelEconomyResult : DistancePerVolumeValue`, which is analogous.\n\n#### **D. Requirement**\n18. **Class `Requirement` exists?**  \n    - **No.** There is a `requirement vehicleFuelEconomyRequirements` block, but not a class.\n\n19. **Attribute `Value : Real`?**  \n    - **No.** Not present.\n\n20. **Attribute `Unit : String`?**  \n    - **No.** Not present.\n\n#### **E.

Class \"Vehicle\" extends Block → Covered\n- 14. \"Vehicle\" class has name \"Vehicle\" → Covered\n- 16. \"Vehicle\" class has attribute \"maxPassengers\" → Partially covered (multiplicity in use case)\n- 17. \"maxPassengers\" attribute is of type \"Integer\" → Partially covered (multiplicity)\n- 18. \"maxPassengers\" attribute has value 4 → Partially covered (multiplicity)\n- 22. Class \"EnvironmentalFactors\" extends Block → Partially covered (\"Environment\" part)\n- 23. \"EnvironmentalFactors\" class has name \"Environmental Factors\" → Partially covered (\"Environment\")\n- 25. Class \"Infrastructure\" extends Block → Partially covered (\"Fuel Station\" part)\n- 7. Class \"Driver\" extends Block → Partially covered (\"Person\" part as \"driver\")\n- 8. \"Driver\" class has name \"Driver\" → Partially covered\n- 10. Class \"Passenger\" extends Block → Partially covered (\"Person\" part as \"passengers\")\n- 11. \"Passenger\" class has name \"Passenger\" → Partially covered\n\nFor recall, we typically count only fully or clearly equivalent coverage. For partial coverage (e.g., \"Person\" instead of \"Driver\"/\"Passenger\"), let's count as covered if the role is clearly represented, even if not as a separate class.\n\nSo, the following claims are covered:\n\n- 7. Class \"Driver\" extends Block (represented as \"Person\" part used as \"driver\")\n- 8. \"Driver\" class has name \"Driver\" (represented as \"driver\" role)\n- 10. Class \"Passenger\" extends Block (represented as \"Person\" part used as \"passengers\")\n- 11. \"Passenger\" class has name \"Passenger\" (represented as \"passengers\" role)\n- 13. Class \"Vehicle\" extends Block\n- 14. \"Vehicle\" class has name \"Vehicle\"\n- 16. \"Vehicle\" class has attribute \"maxPassengers\" (represented as multiplicity [0..4])\n- 17. \"maxPassengers\" attribute is of type \"Integer\" (implied by multiplicity)\n- 18. \"maxPassengers\" attribute has value 4 (implied by multiplicity upper bound)\n- 22. Class \"EnvironmentalFactors\" extends Block (represented as \"Environment\" part)\n- 23. \"EnvironmentalFactors\" class has name \"Environmental Factors\" (as \"Environment\")\n- 25. Class \"Infrastructure\" extends Block (as \"Fuel Station\" part)\n\nThat's 12 claims.\n\n**Total number of claims in the reference model:** 25\n\n**Score: 12/25**"

The structure is similar, but not exactly the same. **Accept as covered.**\n\n#### **20. The part `frontAxle` is composite.**\n- **Covered.** The generated model's comments indicate that `frontAxleAssembly` and its parts are composite.\n\n#### **21. `VehicleConfiguration` has a part `rearAxle` of type `RearAxle`.**\n- **Not covered.** There is a `rearAxle: Axle` in the generated model, but not of type `RearAxle`.\n\n#### **22.
