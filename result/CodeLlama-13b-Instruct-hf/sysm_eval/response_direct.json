Root Component\n- **Reference:** Root component (e.g., \"Automotive System\").\n- **Generated:** `part vehicle` is the root, and the package is named 'AutomotiveSystemArchitectureSafetyViews'.\n- **Covered:** YES (the root is present, though named \"vehicle\" instead of \"Automotive System\", which is acceptable per instructions).\n\n### 2. Subsystems\n- **Reference:** Subsystems like \"Body\", \"Chassis\", \"Engine\", \"Electronics\", \"Safety\", etc.\n- **Generated:** Subsystems under `vehicle` are: `interior`, `bodyAssy`, `wheelAssy`.\n- **Covered:** PARTIALLY. Only \"interior\", \"bodyAssy\", and \"wheelAssy\" are present. \"Chassis\", \"Engine\", \"Electronics\", \"Safety\" are missing as explicit subsystems.\n\n### 3. Components\n- **Reference:** Components like \"Bumper\", \"Seat Belt\", \"Driver Airbag\", \"ABS\", etc.\n- **Generated:** Components present: `alarm`, `seatBelt`, `frontSeat`, `driverAirBag`, `body`, `bumper`, `keylessEntry`, `wheel`, `antilockBrakes`.\n- **Covered:** PARTIALLY. \"Bumper\", \"Seat Belt\", \"Driver Airbag\" are present. \"ABS\" is not explicitly present, but \"antilockBrakes\" may be considered equivalent. Other components from the example list are missing, but the model does include a reasonable set.\n\n### 4. Interfaces\n- **Reference:** Interfaces between subsystems (e.g., \"Body-Chassis\", \"Chassis-Engine\", etc.).\n- **Generated:** No interfaces are defined in the generated model.\n- **Covered:** NO.\n\n### 5. \"Safety\" attribute for all safety-related components\n- **Reference:** All safety-related components have a \"safety\" attribute.\n- **Generated:** Safety-related components are annotated with `@Safety`, which is a metadata definition.\n- **Covered:** YES.\n\n### 6. \"Mandatory\" attribute for all mandatory safety components\n- **Reference:** All mandatory safety components have a \"mandatory\" attribute.\n- **Generated:** The `@Safety` metadata has an `isMandatory` Boolean attribute, set to true for some components.\n- **Covered:** YES (the attribute is called `isMandatory` instead of `mandatory`, but this is acceptable).\n\n### 7. \"Optional\" attribute for all optional safety components\n- **Reference:** All optional safety components have an \"optional\" attribute.\n- **Generated:** The `@Safety` metadata only has `isMandatory : Boolean`, set to false for optional components. There is no explicit \"optional\" attribute.\n- **Covered:** NO (the optionality is encoded as `isMandatory = false`, but there is no explicit \"optional\" attribute).\n\n### 8. Hierarchical view of the system structure\n- **Reference:** There is a hierarchical view of the system structure.\n- **Generated:** `view 'vehicle structure view'` renders as a tree diagram, showing the hierarchy.\n- **Covered:** YES.\n\n### 9. Tabular view of all\n- **Reference:** There is a tabular view of all (components/features).\n- **Generated:** `view 'vehicle tabular views'` includes tabular views for safety and non-safety features.\n- **Covered:** YES.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
