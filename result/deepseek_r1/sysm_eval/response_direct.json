If \"Wheel\" is considered equivalent to \"Tire\", then covered. But the reference model uses \"Tire\" and the generated model uses \"Wheel\" everywhere. For this evaluation, let's accept \"Wheel\" as equivalent to \"Tire\" (since both are the basic wheel/tire part of a vehicle).\n   - **Covered.**\n\n2. **Tire has an attribute mass of type Real.**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model's \"Wheel\" does not have a mass attribute.\n\n3. **There is a part definition Axle.**  \n   - **Covered.** \"Axle\" is defined in the generated model.\n\n4. **Axle has an attribute mass of type Real.**  \n   - **Covered.** \"Axle\" has a mass attribute (though the type is ISQ::mass, which is a more specific type, but semantically equivalent).\n\n5. **Axle contains 2 parts of type Tire (tire[2]).**  \n   - **Partially covered.** In the generated model, \"Axle\" does not directly contain \"Wheel[2]\". Instead, \"AxleAssembly\" contains \"Axle\" and \"Wheel[2]\". The structure is different, but the intent (an axle is associated with two wheels/tires) is preserved via the assembly. Since the reference model's Axle directly contains tires, but the generated model uses an assembly, this is a structural difference.

The structure is more nested, but the semantic is preserved.\n    - **Covered.**\n\n11. **Vehicle contains a part rear of type Axle.**  \n    - **Same as above.** \"rearAxleAssembly\" contains \"rearAxle: Axle\".\n    - **Covered.**\n\n12. **There is a configuration vehicle1_c1.**  \n    - **Covered.** \"vehicle1_c1\" is defined as a specialization of \"vehicle1\".\n\n13. **vehicle1_c1 instantiates v: Vehicle.**  \n    - **Covered.** \"vehicle1_c1\" is a specialization of \"vehicle1\", which is a \"Vehicle\".\n\n14. **In vehicle1_c1, v.mass is set to 2000.**  \n    - **Covered.** \"vehicle1_c1\" redefines \"mass\" to 2000 [kg].\n\n15. **In vehicle1_c1, v.front is set to a new SteeringAxle.**  \n    - **Covered.** \"frontAxle_c1: FrontAxle\" redefines \"frontAxle\" in \"frontAxleAssembly_c1\".\n\n16. **In vehicle1_c1, v.rear is set to a new Axle.**  \n    - **Covered.** \"rearAxle_c1\" redefines \"rearAxle\" in \"rearAxleAssembly_c1\".\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Claim 2 (**Tire has an attribute mass**) is **not covered**.\n- All other claims are **covered** (with some structural differences, but the semantics are preserved).\n\n**Score: 15/16**"

There is a structure named PowerSegment.\n- **Generated model:** No structure named PowerSegment. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 3. PowerSegment has an attribute startTime of type Real.\n- **Generated model:** No PowerSegment. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 4. PowerSegment has an attribute endTime of type Real.\n- **Generated model:** No PowerSegment. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 5.

There is a block named VehicleSimulationSystem.\n- **Generated model:** No block named VehicleSimulationSystem. There is a 'Vehicle' part, and an 'analysis def DynamicsAnalysis', but not a direct equivalent. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 7. VehicleSimulationSystem has an attribute mass of type Real.\n- **Generated model:** 'Vehicle' has attribute mass (of type ISQ::mass). This is equivalent (type is more specific, but semantically matches). **Covered**.\n\n#### 8. VehicleSimulationSystem has an attribute initialPosition of type Real.\n- **Generated model:** 'DynamicsAnalysis' has 'in attribute initialPosition :> ISQ::length'. Equivalent. **Covered**.\n\n#### 9. VehicleSimulationSystem has an attribute initialVelocity of type Real.\n- **Generated model:** 'DynamicsAnalysis' has 'in attribute initialSpeed :> ISQ::speed'.

Equivalent. **Covered**.\n\n#### 12. VehicleSimulationSystem has an attribute velocitySequence of type Sequence<Real>.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit velocity sequence returned, but 'speed' is updated in the loop. However, only accelerationProfile is returned. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 13. VehicleSimulationSystem has an attribute displacementSequence of type Sequence<Real>.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit displacement/position sequence returned, only 'position' is updated internally. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 14. VehicleSimulationSystem has an operation runSimulation with input timeStep of type Real.\n- **Generated model:** 'DynamicsAnalysis' has 'in attribute deltaT :> ISQ::time', which is the time step.

Part vehicle (Vehicle)\n- 12. Part alarm (Vehicle has part alarm)\n- 13. Part seatBelt (Vehicle has part seatBelt)\n- 15. Part airbag (Vehicle has part airbag)\n- 18. Part bumper (Vehicle has part bumper)\n- 19. Part keylessEntry (Vehicle has part keylessEntry)\n- 22. Part abs/antilockBrakes (Vehicle has part abs: AntiLockBrakingSystem)\n\nHowever, in the generated model, these parts are not always at the same location or with the same structure (e.g., inside interior/bodyAssy/wheelAssy, as arrays, or with annotations). The reference model defines all these parts directly under Vehicle, not nested or as arrays, and without annotations.\n\nGiven the instruction to ignore formatting or identifier naming differences if the structure and semantics match, but **not** to ignore structural differences like containment, the following applies:\n\n- If a part is present but nested differently, it is **not** fully supported.\n- If a part is present but with a different name, but the semantics match, it is supported.\n\nSo, let's re-express:\n\n- 10. Part vehicle: **Supported** (Vehicle)\n- 12. Part alarm inside interior: **Not supported** (alarm is not inside interior in reference)\n- 13. Part seatBelt[2] inside interior: **Not supported** (seatBelt is not inside interior or an array in reference)\n- 15. Part driverAirBag inside interior: **Not supported** (airbag is not inside interior or named driverAirBag in reference)\n- 18. Part bumper inside bodyAssy: **Not supported** (bumper is not inside bodyAssy in reference)\n- 19. Part keylessEntry inside bodyAssy: **Not supported** (keylessEntry is not inside bodyAssy in reference)\n- 22. Part antilockBrakes[2] inside wheelAssy: **Not supported** (abs is not inside wheelAssy or an array in reference)\n\nSo, **only claim 10 is fully supported**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n| # | Reference Claim | Covered in Generated Model? | Notes |\n|---|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------|\n| 1 | Abstract def Feature | **No** | No explicit abstract \"Feature\" concept. |\n| 2 | SafetyFeature :> Feature | **Partial** | \"Safety\" is a metadata annotation, not a type/subtype. |\n| 3 | SecurityFeature :> Feature | **Partial** | \"Security\" is a metadata annotation, not a type/subtype. |\n| 4 | MandatorySafetyFeature :> SafetyFeature | **Partial** | \"isMandatory\" attribute on @Safety annotation, not a type. |\n| 5 | OptionalSafetyFeature :> SafetyFeature | **Partial** | \"isMandatory = false\" used, but not as a type. |\n| 6 | SeatBelt :> MandatorySafetyFeature | **Partial** | seatBelt part with @Safety{isMandatory=true}, but not as a type. |\n| 7 | Bumper :> MandatorySafetyFeature | **Partial** | bumper part with @Safety{isMandatory=true}, but not as a type. |\n| 8 | Airbag :> OptionalSafetyFeature | **Partial** | driverAirBag part with @Safety{isMandatory=false}, but not as a type. |\n| 9 | AntiLockBrakingSystem :> OptionalSafetyFeature | **Partial** | antilockBrakes part with @Safety{isMandatory=false}, but not as a type. |\n| 10 | Alarm :> SecurityFeature | **Partial** | alarm part with @Security annotation, not as a type. |\n| 11 | KeylessEntrySystem :> SecurityFeature | **Partial** | keylessEntry part with @Security annotation, not as a type. |\n| 12 | Vehicle has part seatBelt: SeatBelt | **Yes** | seatBelt part present (with multiplicity 2). |\n| 13 | Vehicle has part airbag: Airbag | **Yes** | driverAirBag present (name differs, but matches intent). |\n| 14 | Vehicle has part bumper: Bumper | **Yes** | bumper part present. |\n| 15 | Vehicle has part abs: AntiLockBrakingSystem | **Yes** | antilockBrakes part present (name differs, but matches intent). |\n| 16 | Vehicle has part alarm: Alarm | **Yes** | alarm part present. |\n| 17 | Vehicle has part keylessEntry: KeylessEntrySystem | **Yes** | keylessEntry part present. |\n| 18 | VehicleSafetySecuritySystem defined | **No** | No such system definition. |\n| 19 | VehicleSafetySecuritySystem has reference target: Vehicle | **No** | No such reference. |\n| 20 | VehicleSafetySecuritySystem has requirement displayReq | **Partial** | No explicit requirement, but views for display exist. |\n| 21 | VehicleSafetySecuritySystem satisfies displayReq | **Partial** | No explicit satisfy, but views for display exist. |\n\n#### Notes on Partial Coverage:\n- The generated model uses annotations and attributes to represent safety/security and mandatory/optional, rather than explicit type hierarchies.

The type of `engine` is not explicitly stated as `Engine`, but it is present as a part.\n- **Covered:** Partially. The containment is present, but the type `Engine` is not explicitly defined as such. However, the `engine` part performs `providePower.generateTorque`, which links it to the logical function.

ISQ::torque is a type, likely representing a physical quantity (torque).\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 8.

The mapping is equivalent.\n\n11. **Default value for `option` in `Diameter` is `DiameterOption::Small`.**  \n    - **Covered.** The generated model defines `aperatureDiameter: DiameterChoice = DiameterChoice::small;` which is equivalent.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nAll 11 atomic claims are covered by the generated model, either directly or with acceptable naming/structural differences.\n\n**Score: 11/11**"

This is not equivalent.\n- Claims 5, 6, 8, 9: The port names differ, but the structure (direction, type) matches. **Count as covered.**\n- Claims 10, 11, 12: The system part is named `vehicle: Vehicle` instead of `VehicleFuelSystem`, but the structure is equivalent. **Count as covered.**\n\nSo, the revised table:\n\n| # | Reference Claim | Covered? | Notes |\n|---|-----------------|----------|-------|\n| 1 | Value type `Fuel` | Yes | |\n| 2 | `Fuel.mass: Real` | No | |\n| 3 | `Fuel.temperature: Real` | No | |\n| 4 | Part def `FuelTankAssembly` | Yes | |\n| 5 | `FuelTankAssembly.supplyPort: out Fuel` | Yes | |\n| 6 | `FuelTankAssembly.returnPort: in Fuel` | Yes | |\n| 7 | Part def `Engine` | Yes | |\n| 8 | `Engine.fuelInPort: in Fuel` | Yes | |\n| 9 | `Engine.returnPort: out Fuel` | Yes | |\n|10 | Part def `VehicleFuelSystem` | Yes | |\n|11 | `VehicleFuelSystem.fuelTank: FuelTankAssembly` | Yes | |\n|12 | `VehicleFuelSystem.engine: Engine` | Yes | |\n|13 | Connection `supplyLine: fuelTank.supplyPort -> engine.fuelInPort` | Yes | |\n|14 | Connection `returnLine: engine.returnPort -> fuelTank.returnPort` | No | |\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For this evaluation, let's accept it as covered.\n5. **Definition of block `Vehicle` with:**  \n    5.1. **Attribute `mass` of type `MassValue`**  \n        - **Partially covered.** The generated model has `mass: Real`, not `MassValue`. The type is less specific, so not fully covered.\n    5.2. **Attribute `state` of type `VehicleStateValue`**  \n        - **Covered** as `status: VehicleStatus`.\n    5.3. **Containment of `engine` part of type `Engine` (multiplicity 1)**  \n        - **Covered** as `part eng: Engine`.\n    5.4. **Containment of `driver` part of type `Driver` (multiplicity 1)**  \n        - **Partially covered.** The generated model has `ref part driver: Person`. The use of `ref` may indicate a reference, not containment, and the type is `Person` instead of `Driver`. Let's count this as not fully covered.\n6. **Definition of part `Vehicle_1` of type `Vehicle`**  \n   - **Covered** as `individual part def Vehicle_1 :> Vehicle`.\n7. **Initial snapshot:**  \n    7.1. **`Vehicle_1.mass = 2000`**  \n        - **Covered** as `mass = 2000.0` in `vehicle_1_t0`.\n    7.2. **`Vehicle_1.state.gear = 0`**  \n        - **Covered** as `status.gearSetting = 0` in `vehicle_1_t0`.\n    7.3. **`Vehicle_1.state.acceleratorPosition = 0.0`**  \n        - **Covered** as `status.acceleratorPosition = 0.0` in `vehicle_1_t0`.\n8. **Next snapshot:**  \n    8.1. **`Vehicle_1.mass = 1500`**  \n        - **Covered** as `mass = 1500.0` in `vehicle_1_t1`.\n    8.2. **`Vehicle_1.state.gear = 2`**  \n        - **Covered** as `status.gearSetting = 2` in `vehicle_1_t1`.\n    8.3. **`Vehicle_1.state.acceleratorPosition = 0.5`**  \n        - **Covered** as `status.acceleratorPosition = 0.5` in `vehicle_1_t1`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n1.

Covered (Vehicle_1)\n7.1. Covered (mass = 2000)\n7.2. Covered (gear = 0)\n7.3. Covered (acceleratorPosition = 0.0)\n8.1. Covered (mass = 1500)\n8.2. Covered (gear = 2)\n8.3. Covered (acceleratorPosition = 0.5)\n\n**Covered claims:**\n2, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4, 5.2, 5.3, 6, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 = 13 claims\n\n**Not covered:**\n1, 5.1, 5.4 = 3 claims\n\n**Total claims:** 16 (if we count 2, 2.1, 2.2 as separate, etc.)\n\nBut in the initial list, I had 14 claims. Let's clarify:\n\n1. MassValue definition\n2. VehicleStateValue definition\n3. VehicleStateValue.gear\n4. VehicleStateValue.acceleratorPosition\n5. Engine block\n6. Driver block\n7. Vehicle.mass\n8. Vehicle.state\n9. Vehicle.engine\n10. Vehicle.driver\n11. Vehicle_1 part\n12. Initial snapshot mass\n13. Initial snapshot gear\n14. Initial snapshot acceleratorPosition\n15. Next snapshot mass\n16. Next snapshot gear\n17. Next snapshot acceleratorPosition\n\nSo, actually, there are 17 atomic claims.\n\nNow, let's mark which are covered:\n\n1. MassValue definition — Not covered\n2. VehicleStateValue definition — Covered (VehicleStatus)\n3. VehicleStateValue.gear — Covered (gearSetting)\n4. VehicleStateValue.acceleratorPosition — Covered\n5. Engine block — Covered\n6. Driver block — Covered (Person)\n7. Vehicle.mass — Not covered (type mismatch)\n8. Vehicle.state — Covered (status)\n9. Vehicle.engine — Covered\n10.

Initial snapshot acceleratorPosition — Covered\n15. Next snapshot mass — Covered\n16. Next snapshot gear — Covered\n17. Next snapshot acceleratorPosition — Covered\n\n**Covered claims:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 = 14\n\n**Not covered:** 1, 7, 10 = 3\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n**Score: 14/17**"

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n**A. Package and Imports**\n1. **Package exists**: The generated model has a package (`VehicleDynamicsCalculation`). **(Covered, name difference ignored)**\n2. **Imports**: The generated model imports `ScalarValues::Real` and `ISQ::*`. **(Not covered: 'Systems' and 'BaseUnits' not explicitly imported, but types are present)**\n3. **Imports**: Same as above. **(Not covered)**\n\n**B. Block Definition**\n4. **Block exists**: The generated model has a part `VehicleDynamics` (equivalent to a block). **(Covered)**\n\n**C. Value Properties (Attributes) in the Block**\n5. **mass**: `mass : MassValue` in generated model. **(Covered)**\n6. **wheelPower**: `wheelPower : PowerValue` in generated model. **(Covered)**\n7. **dragCoefficient**: `C_d : Real` in generated model. **(Covered, naming difference)**\n8. **rollingResistanceCoefficient**: `C_f : Real` in generated model. **(Covered, naming difference)**\n9. **initialSpeed**: Not present in generated model. **(Not covered)**\n10. **initialPosition**: Not present in generated model. **(Not covered)**\n11. **airDensity**: Not present in generated model. **(Not covered)**\n12. **frontalArea**: Not present in generated model. **(Not covered)**\n13. **timeStep**: `delta_t : TimeValue` in updateState and other calcs. **(Covered, naming difference)**\n14. **currentSpeed**: `currState.v` in updateState, and `v` in `DynamicState`. **(Covered)**\n15. **currentPosition**: `currState.x` in updateState, and `x` in `DynamicState`. **(Covered)**\n16. **acceleration**: Calculated in `Acceleration` calc def, but not stored as an attribute. **(Partially covered: present as a calculation, not as a stored property)**\n\n**D. Constraints (Formulas/Relations)**\n17. **F_air**: In `Power` calc, `drag = Cd * v` (but reference model uses `0.5 * dragCoefficient * airDensity * frontalArea * currentSpeed^2`). The generated model's drag is much simpler and omits airDensity, frontalArea, and the 0.5 factor, and uses linear instead of quadratic in speed. **(Not covered)**\n18. **F_roll**: In `Power` calc, `friction = Cf * tm * v` (reference model: `rollingResistanceCoefficient * mass * 9.81`). The generated model uses a different formula (proportional to speed), so **(Not covered)**\n19. **F_wheel**: In `Power` calc, `whlpwr` is used directly, but in the reference model, it's `wheelPower / currentSpeed` (if speed > 0). **(Not covered)**\n20. **F_net**: In `Power` calc, `return : PowerValue = whlpwr - drag - friction;` (reference model: `F_net = F_wheel - F_air - F_roll`). The structure is similar, but the terms are not equivalent. **(Partially covered: structure matches, but semantics do not)**\n21. **acceleration**: In `Acceleration` calc, `tp / (tm * v)` (reference model: `F_net / mass`). The generated model divides by `mass * v`, not just `mass`. **(Not covered)**\n22. **nextSpeed**: In `Velocity` calc, `v0 + a * dt` (reference model: `currentSpeed + acceleration * timeStep`). **(Covered)**\n23. **nextPosition**: In `Position` calc, `x0 + v * dt` (reference model: `currentPosition + currentSpeed * timeStep`). **(Covered)**\n\n**E. State Machine**\n24. **State machine**: No explicit state machine in generated model. **(Not covered)**\n25. **Initial state and transition**: Not present. **(Not covered)**\n26. **Operational state with do-activity**: The updateState calc in generated model updates state, but not as a state machine. **(Partially covered: state update logic present, but not as a state machine)**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Let's be generous and count these as covered if the semantics match.\n\nSo, let's revisit claims 6-11 and 14-19:\n\n6. **runSimulation input initialVelocity: Real**  \n   - **Covered** (v_in : ISQ::SpeedValue)\n7. **runSimulation input initialPosition: Real**  \n   - **Covered** (x_in : ISQ::LengthValue)\n8. **runSimulation input acceleration: Real**  \n   - **Covered** (a : ISQ::AccelerationValue)\n9. **runSimulation input timeStep: Real**  \n   - **Covered** (dt : ISQ::TimeValue)\n10. **runSimulation output finalVelocity: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (v_out : ISQ::SpeedValue)\n11. **runSimulation output finalPosition: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (x_out : ISQ::LengthValue)\n\n14. **SimulateDynamics input initialVelocity: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (v_in : ISQ::SpeedValue)\n15. **SimulateDynamics input initialPosition: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (x_in : ISQ::LengthValue)\n16. **SimulateDynamics input acceleration: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (a : ISQ::AccelerationValue)\n17. **SimulateDynamics input timeStep: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (dt : ISQ::TimeValue)\n18. **SimulateDynamics output finalVelocity: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (v_out : ISQ::SpeedValue)\n19. **SimulateDynamics output finalPosition: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (x_out : ISQ::LengthValue)\n\nSimilarly, for ModelCenter::compute (claims 31-36), the generated model does not define a ModelCenter block or operation, but the action `computeDynamics` is annotated with metadata indicating it is executed by ModelCenter. Let's see if this is sufficient to count as coverage for the operation and its parameters.\n\n- The metadata ToolExecution { toolName = \"ModelCenter\"; ... } suggests that this action is implemented by ModelCenter.\n- The parameters match in semantics.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n31. **compute input initialVelocity: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (v_in)\n32. **compute input initialPosition: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (x_in)\n33. **compute input acceleration: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (a)\n34. **compute input timeStep: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (dt)\n35. **compute output finalVelocity: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (v_out)\n36. **compute output finalPosition: Real**  \n    - **Covered** (x_out)\n\nSo, claims 6-11, 14-19, and 31-36 are covered (18 claims).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Covered claims:**\n1. Package (claim 1)\n2. runSimulation parameters (claims 6-11)\n3. SimulateDynamics parameters (claims 14-19)\n4. ModelCenter::compute parameters (claims 31-36)\n\nTotal covered:  \n- claim 1 (package)  \n- claims 6-11 (6)  \n- claims 14-19 (6)  \n- claims 31-36 (6)  \n= 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 = **19**\n\n**Total claims:** 44\n\n---\n\n**Score: 19/44**"
