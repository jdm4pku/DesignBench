The name is slightly different, but the structure and semantics match (both are about the vehicle's power transmission/powertrain system).\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n### 2. Interface: `FuelCommandPort` of type `ControlSignalPort`, direction `Input`\n- **Generated model:** There is a port definition `FuelCmdPort`.

The port \"pb\" of \"c2\" is bound to an interface named \"pe\".\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1. There is a system named \"Multi-ArchitectureSystem\".\n\n- **Generated model:** The package is named 'Multi-ArchitectureSystemIntegration', which is a variant of the name. Since naming differences are to be ignored if the structure matches, this is **covered**.\n\n#### 2. The system is decomposed into at least one subsystem.\n\n- **Generated model:** There are parts a11 and a12, each with further decomposition. This is **covered**.\n\n#### 3. There is a subsystem named \"b11\".\n\n- **Generated model:** There is a part b11: B11 within a11. This is **covered**.\n\n#### 4. \"b11\" contains a component named \"c1\".\n\n- **Generated model:** Within b11, there is part c1: C1. This is **covered**.\n\n#### 5. \"c1\" contains a component named \"c2\".\n\n- **Generated model:** Within b11, there is also part c2: C2, but c2 is not nested within c1; both c1 and c2 are direct children of b11. In the reference, c2 is nested within c1, which is nested within b11. In the generated model, both c1 and c2 are siblings under b11.\n\n- **Is this equivalent?** The reference model's structure is: b11 > c1 > c2. The generated model's structure is: b11 > c1 and b11 > c2.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The containment relationship (c2 inside c1) is **not covered**; c2 is not a part of c1 in the generated model.\n\n#### 6. \"c2\" has a port named \"pb\".\n\n- **Generated model:** C2 has a port named \"pc\", not \"pb\". C1 has a port \"pb\". In the reference, c2 has port \"pb\". In the generated, c2 has \"pc\", c1 has \"pb\".\n\n- **Conclusion:** The port \"pb\" on c2 is **not covered**.\n\n#### 7. The port \"pb\" of \"c2\" is bound to an interface named \"pe\".\n\n- **Generated model:** There is a binding: port :>> pe = c1.pb { ... } in b11. This binds b11's port pe to c1's pb. In the reference, c2.pb is bound to pe. In the generated, c1.pb is bound to pe.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The binding of c2.pb to pe is **not covered**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The \"Vehicle\" component defines a state named \"Shutdown\".\n- **Generated model:** In the state machine for 'vehicle states', there is a state named \"off\", which is likely semantically equivalent to \"Shutdown\". No explicit \"Shutdown\" state, but \"off\" is the initial state and is the target of the \"on-off\" transition, matching the shutdown semantics.\n- **Covered:** Yes (by semantic equivalence)\n\n#### 3. The \"Vehicle\" component defines a state named \"Startup\".\n- **Generated model:** There is a state named \"starting\" in the 'operational states' of 'vehicle states', which is entered from \"off\" (shutdown) upon receiving a \"Vehicle Start Signal\" and with a condition. This matches the \"Startup\" state.\n- **Covered:** Yes (by semantic equivalence)\n\n#### 4. The \"Vehicle\" component defines a state named \"Operational\".\n- **Generated model:** There is a state named \"on\" in 'operational states', which is entered after \"starting\" and is the main active state. This matches \"Operational\".\n- **Covered:** Yes (by semantic equivalence)\n\n#### 5. The \"Vehicle\" component defines a state named \"Degraded\".\n- **Generated model:** In 'health states', there is a state named \"degraded\", entered from \"normal\" when temperature is too high. This matches \"Degraded\".\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 6. The \"Vehicle\" component defines a state named \"Maintenance\".\n- **Generated model:** In 'health states', there is a state named \"maintenance\", entered from \"normal\" at a certain time, and can return to \"normal\". This matches \"Maintenance\".\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 7. The \"Vehicle\" component defines a state named \"Fault\".\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit state named \"Fault\" in the 'vehicle states' or 'health states'. The closest is \"degraded\", but \"fault\" is not explicitly modeled.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n#### 8. The \"Vehicle\" component defines a state named \"Restored\".\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit state named \"Restored\". However, transitions from \"degraded\" or \"maintenance\" to \"normal\" are triggered by \"Return to Normal\", which is an event/trigger, not a state. \"Restored\" as a state is not present.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Inside \"FuelStatus\", there is a namespace \"FullyFueled\".\n\n**Total atomic claims: 11**\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1. The model defines a namespace \"AutomobileSpecificationManagement\".\n- **Generated model:** The top-level package is named 'AutomotiveSpecificationSystem', not \"AutomobileSpecificationManagement\". However, the naming is not required to match exactly if the structure and semantics are equivalent. The generated model does not have a namespace or package named \"AutomobileSpecificationManagement\".\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 2. Inside \"AutomobileSpecificationManagement\", there is a namespace \"Vehicle\".\n- **Generated model:** There is a package 'Vehicle Definitions', which contains the definition of Vehicle, but not a namespace \"Vehicle\" as such.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 3. Inside \"Vehicle\", there is a namespace \"MassGrade\".\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit \"MassGrade\" namespace or equivalent.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 4. Inside \"MassGrade\", there is a namespace \"2000kg\".\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit \"2000kg\" namespace, but there are instances of Vehicle with mass = 2000kg.\n- **Covered?** **Partial** (The value is present as an attribute, but the namespace structure is not.)\n\n#### 5. Inside \"2000kg\", there is a namespace \"MaxMassLimit\".\n- **Generated model:** No explicit \"MaxMassLimit\" namespace, but there are requirements that specify mass limits.\n- **Covered?** **Partial** (The concept is present as a requirement, but not as a namespace.)\n\n#### 6. Inside \"MaxMassLimit\", there is a namespace \"2000kg\".\n- **Generated model:** The value 2000kg is present as a requirement and as an attribute value.\n- **Covered?** **Partial** (Value present, but not as a namespace.)\n\n#### 7. Inside \"MassGrade\", there is a namespace \"2500kg\".\n- **Generated model:** There is a vehicle with mass = 2500kg.\n- **Covered?** **Partial** (Value present, not as a namespace.)\n\n#### 8. Inside \"2500kg\", there is a namespace \"MaxMassLimit\".\n- **Generated model:** There is a requirement for mass = 2500kg.\n- **Covered?** **Partial** (Concept present, not as a namespace.)\n\n#### 9. Inside \"MaxMassLimit\", there is a namespace \"2500kg\".\n- **Generated model:** Value 2500kg is present as a requirement and attribute value.\n- **Covered?** **Partial** (Value present, not as a namespace.)\n\n#### 10. Inside \"Vehicle\", there is a namespace \"FuelStatus\".\n- **Generated model:** There are attributes and constraints for fuelLevel and fuelTankCapacity, and requirements referencing fuel status (e.g., fuelLevel >= fuelTankCapacity, fuelLevel == 0.0).\n- **Covered?** **Yes** (The concept of fuel status is modeled via attributes and constraints.)\n\n#### 11. Inside \"FuelStatus\", there is a namespace \"FullyFueled\".\n- **Generated model:** There is a requirement/constraint that vehicle.fuelLevel >= vehicle.fuelTankCapacity, which corresponds to \"FullyFueled\".\n- **Covered?** **Yes**\n\n---\n\n#### Let's clarify the coverage:\n\n- Claims 1-3: **No** (no such namespaces)\n- Claims 4-9: **Partial** (the values and concepts are present, but not as namespaces)\n- Claims 10-11: **Yes** (the concepts are present and modeled)\n\nHowever, per the instructions, coverage is about whether the generated model contains the same or equivalent element, ignoring naming and formatting. The reference model uses namespaces to represent mass grades and fuel status, while the generated model uses attributes, values, and requirements.\n\nLet's reinterpret the claims in terms of their semantic content, not just the namespace structure:\n\n- The reference model is modeling:\n  - The existence of mass grades (2000kg, 2500kg) as categories or values.\n  - The existence of a maximum mass limit for each grade.\n  - The existence of a fuel status, with a \"FullyFueled\" state.\n\nThe generated model:\n- Has vehicles with mass = 2000kg and 2500kg.\n- Has requirements that specify mass limits (massActual <= massReqd, with massReqd = 2000kg or 2500kg).\n- Has attributes for fuelLevel and fuelTankCapacity, and requirements/constraints for being fully fueled (fuelLevel >= fuelTankCapacity).\n\nTherefore, **all the semantic content of the reference model is present in the generated model**, even if the structure is different.\n\nSo, for each claim:\n\n1. \"AutomobileSpecificationManagement\" namespace: **Equivalent to the top-level package** → **Covered**\n2. \"Vehicle\" namespace: **Equivalent to 'Vehicle Definitions'** → **Covered**\n3. \"MassGrade\" namespace: **Modeled via mass attribute and requirements** → **Covered**\n4. \"2000kg\" mass grade: **Modeled via vehicle1_c1 mass = 2000kg** → **Covered**\n5. \"MaxMassLimit\" for 2000kg: **Modeled via requirement massReqd = 2000kg** → **Covered**\n6. \"2000kg\" under MaxMassLimit: **Modeled via requirement massReqd = 2000kg** → **Covered**\n7. \"2500kg\" mass grade: **Modeled via vehicle1_c2 mass = 2500kg** → **Covered**\n8. \"MaxMassLimit\" for 2500kg: **Modeled via requirement massReqd = 2500kg** → **Covered**\n9. \"2500kg\" under MaxMassLimit: **Modeled via requirement massReqd = 2500kg** → **Covered**\n10. \"FuelStatus\" namespace: **Modeled via fuelLevel/fuelTankCapacity attributes** → **Covered**\n11. \"FullyFueled\" under FuelStatus: **Modeled via constraint fuelLevel >= fuelTankCapacity** → **Covered**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The attribute \"type\" has a constraint: value can be \"optional\".\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\n#### 1. Package \"VehicleSafetyAndSecuritySystem\"\n- **Generated model** has a package named \"VehicleSafetyandSecurityFeatureManagement\". The name is slightly different, but the structure and semantics match.\n- **Covered**.\n\n#### 2. Required dependency: \"MandatorySafetyFeatures\" → \"SeatBelts\"\n- **Generated model**: There is no explicit grouping named \"MandatorySafetyFeatures\", but \"seatBelt\" parts are annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`. The concept of mandatory safety features is present, but not as a named group or dependency.\n- **Partially covered** (the seat belts are present and marked as mandatory, but the explicit dependency/grouping is not).\n\n#### 3. Required dependency: \"MandatorySafetyFeatures\" → \"Bumpers\"\n- **Generated model**: \"bumper\" part exists and is annotated as `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`. Same as above.\n- **Partially covered**.\n\n#### 4. Optional dependency: \"OptionalSafetyFeatures\" → \"Airbags\"\n- **Generated model**: \"driverAirBag\" part exists and is annotated as `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`. No explicit \"OptionalSafetyFeatures\" group or dependency.\n- **Partially covered**.\n\n#### 5. Optional dependency: \"OptionalSafetyFeatures\" → \"AntiLockBrakingSystems\"\n- **Generated model**: \"antilockBrakes\" part exists and is annotated as `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`. No explicit \"OptionalSafetyFeatures\" group or dependency.\n- **Partially covered**.\n\n#### 6. Required dependency: \"SecurityDevices\" → \"Alarms\"\n- **Generated model**: \"alarm\" part exists and is annotated with `@Security;`. No explicit \"SecurityDevices\" group or dependency.\n- **Partially covered**.\n\n#### 7. Required dependency: \"SecurityDevices\" → \"KeylessEntrySystems\"\n- **Generated model**: \"keylessEntry\" part exists and is annotated with `@Security;`. No explicit \"SecurityDevices\" group or dependency.\n- **Partially covered**.\n\n#### 8. Type \"SafetyFeature\"\n- **Generated model**: There is a metadata definition `Safety` used as an annotation, which is functionally equivalent to a type for safety features.\n- **Covered**.\n\n#### 9. Attribute \"type\" (string) for \"SafetyFeature\"\n- **Generated model**: The annotation `@Safety` has an attribute `isMandatory : Boolean`. This is not a string attribute named \"type\", but it encodes the same information (mandatory/optional).\n- **Covered (semantically equivalent)**.\n\n#### 10. Constraint: \"type\" can be \"mandatory\"\n- **Generated model**: `isMandatory = true` encodes \"mandatory\".\n- **Covered (semantically equivalent)**.\n\n#### 11. Constraint: \"type\" can be \"optional\"\n- **Generated model**: `isMandatory = false` encodes \"optional\".\n- **Covered (semantically equivalent)**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the claims:\n\n- **Total claims:** 11\n\nNow, for each claim, let's decide if it is covered:\n\n| # | Claim | Covered? |\n|---|-------|----------|\n| 1 | Package | Yes |\n| 2 | Dependency: MandatorySafetyFeatures → SeatBelts | Partially (seatBelts present and marked, but no explicit group/dependency) |\n| 3 | Dependency: MandatorySafetyFeatures → Bumpers | Partially (bumpers present and marked, but no explicit group/dependency) |\n| 4 | Dependency: OptionalSafetyFeatures → Airbags | Partially (airbags present and marked, but no explicit group/dependency) |\n| 5 | Dependency: OptionalSafetyFeatures → AntiLockBrakingSystems | Partially (antilockBrakes present and marked, but no explicit group/dependency) |\n| 6 | Dependency: SecurityDevices → Alarms | Partially (alarms present and marked, but no explicit group/dependency) |\n| 7 | Dependency: SecurityDevices → KeylessEntrySystems | Partially (keylessEntry present and marked, but no explicit group/dependency) |\n| 8 | Type: SafetyFeature | Yes |\n| 9 | Attribute: type (string) | Yes (semantically) |\n| 10 | Constraint: \"mandatory\" | Yes (semantically) |\n| 11 | Constraint: \"optional\" | Yes (semantically) |\n\nFor recall, we count a claim as covered if the information is present, even if the grouping is not explicit, as long as the semantics are preserved.\n\n- Claims 2-7: The actual features are present and correctly marked as mandatory/optional/security, even though the explicit groupings/dependencies are not modeled. Since the atomic claim is about the existence of the dependency (i.e., that these features are grouped as mandatory/optional/security), and the generated model encodes this via annotations and views (e.g., `vehicleMandatorySafetyFeatureView`), we can consider these as **covered** for recall purposes, since the information is present and can be queried.\n\n**Therefore, all 11 claims are covered.**\n\n---\n\n## Final Score\n\n**Score: 11/11**"

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a class named `Material`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute def Material :> Substance;`\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 2. `Material` has an attribute `atomicMass` of type `Quantity`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute atomicMass: AtomicMassValue[1];` in `Metal`, but not in `Material`. However, `Metal` is a subclass of `Material`, and in the generated model, `Metal` is a subclass of `Material`, and `atomicMass` is defined in `Metal`. In the reference, `atomicMass` is in `Material`, so all subclasses inherit it. In the generated model, only `Metal` and its subclasses have it.\n- **Covered:** **Partially**. The attribute exists, but not in the same class. For recall, we check if the generated model allows all `Material` instances to have `atomicMass`. Since in the generated model, a `Material` that is not a `Metal` would not have `atomicMass`, this is **not fully covered**.\n\n#### 3. `Material` has an attribute `composition` of type `Composition`.\n- **Generated model:** There is no attribute `composition` in `Material`. However, `Alloy` has `fractions: MaterialFraction[2..*]`, which is a kind of composition, but not in `Material`. In the reference, all `Material` have `composition`.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n#### 4. `Material` has an attribute `mechanicalPropertyIndicators` of type `PropertyIndicatorSet`.\n- **Generated model:** No such attribute or equivalent.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n#### 5. There is a class named `Metal`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute def Metal :> Material { ... }`\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 6. `Metal` inherits from `Material`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute def Metal :> Material { ... }`\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 7. `Metal` has an attribute `tensileStrength` of type `Quantity`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute def TensileStrengthValue :> ScalarQuantityValue ...` and in `Steel_980: Alloy`, `attribute tensileStrength: TensileStrengthValue = 980 ['N/mm²'];`. However, in the class `Metal`, there is no attribute `tensileStrength`. Only in the instance `Steel_980: Alloy`.\n- **Covered:** **No** (attribute is not in `Metal` class, only in an instance of `Alloy`)\n\n#### 8. There is a class named `Alloy`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute def Alloy :> Material { ... }`\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 9. `Alloy` inherits from `Metal`.\n- **Generated model:** `attribute def Alloy :> Material { ... }` (but not from `Metal`)\n- **Covered:** **No** (Alloy inherits from Material, not Metal)\n\n#### 10. `Alloy` has an attribute `massFraction` of type `MassFraction`.\n- **Generated model:** `Alloy` has `fractions: MaterialFraction[2..*]`, and `MaterialFraction` has `massFraction: MassFractionValue[1];`. So, the mass fraction is modeled as a property of a contained class, not directly as an attribute of `Alloy`. The reference model has `massFraction` as an attribute of `Alloy`.\n- **Covered:** **Partially**. The information is present, but not as a direct attribute. For recall, if the information is present in an equivalent way, we can count it as covered.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- 1.

There are no attributes, names, or further structure or content provided for any of these elements.\n\n**Atomic claims:**\nLet's enumerate the minimal, meaningful modeling elements present:\n\n1. There is a SysML v2 model.\n2. The model contains a System.\n3. The System contains an Interaction.\n4. The Interaction contains an InteractionType.\n5. The first InteractionType contains another InteractionType.\n6. The second InteractionType contains another InteractionType.\n7. ...\n8. This nesting continues for 28 levels of `<InteractionType>`.\n\nSo, the atomic claims are:\n- The existence of a SysML v2 model.\n- The existence of a System.\n- The System contains an Interaction.\n- The Interaction contains an InteractionType, which is nested 28 times.\n\n**Let's count the claims:**\n- 1: SysML v2 model\n- 2: System\n- 3: System contains Interaction\n- 4: Interaction contains first InteractionType\n- 5: First InteractionType contains second InteractionType\n- 6: Second InteractionType contains third InteractionType\n- ...\n- 31: 28th InteractionType contains 29th InteractionType\n\nBut in the provided text, there are 28 nested `<InteractionType>` elements (counting the number of `<InteractionType>` tags). So, the claims are:\n\n- 1: SysML v2 model\n- 2: System\n- 3: System contains Interaction\n- 4: Interaction contains first InteractionType\n- 5: First InteractionType contains second InteractionType\n- 6: Second InteractionType contains third InteractionType\n- ...\n- 31: 28th InteractionType\n\nBut the last `<InteractionType>` does not contain another; it's just the innermost. So, the claims are:\n\n- 1: SysML v2 model\n- 2: System\n- 3: System contains Interaction\n- 4: Interaction contains first InteractionType\n- 5: First InteractionType contains second InteractionType\n- ...\n- 31: 28th InteractionType exists\n\nSo, total atomic claims: 1 (SysML v2) + 1 (System) + 1 (Interaction) + 28 (InteractionType existences) = **31**.\n\nBut, more precisely, the claims are:\n- The existence of each element (SysML v2, System, Interaction, and each InteractionType).\n- The containment relationship between each parent and child.\n\nSo, for each level, there are two claims: the existence of the element, and the containment.\n\nBut since the model is only a chain of nested elements, and each is only meaningful in terms of its existence and containment, let's list them as:\n\n1. There is a SysML v2 model.\n2. The model contains a System.\n3. The System contains an Interaction.\n4. The Interaction contains an InteractionType.\n5. The first InteractionType contains a second InteractionType.\n6. The second InteractionType contains a third InteractionType.\n...\nn. The 27th InteractionType contains a 28th InteractionType.\n\nSo, for 28 nested InteractionTypes, there are 28 existence claims and 27 containment claims (since the last one does not contain another).\n\nSo, total claims:\n- 1: SysML v2 model exists\n- 1: System exists\n- 1: Interaction exists\n- 28: InteractionType exists (one for each level)\n- 1: SysML v2 contains System\n- 1: System contains Interaction\n- 1: Interaction contains first InteractionType\n- 27: Each InteractionType contains the next (from 1st to 27th)\n\nSo, total claims:\n- Existence: 1 (SysML v2) + 1 (System) + 1 (Interaction) + 28 (InteractionType) = 31\n- Containment: 1 (SysML v2->System) + 1 (System->Interaction) + 1 (Interaction->1st InteractionType) + 27 (InteractionType->InteractionType) = 30\n\nTotal atomic claims: 31 (existence) + 30 (containment) = **61**\n\nBut, in practice, for recall, we only need to check if the generated model covers the same structure: a system with an interaction with nested interaction types.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\n**Generated Model:**\nThe generated model defines a package 'CruiseControlProtocol' with parts, items, events, and an occurrence definition for an interaction.\n\nDoes it contain:\n- A SysML v2 model? **Yes** (implicit, as it's a SysML v2 model).\n- A System? **No explicit 'System' element**; the top-level is a package.\n- An Interaction? **Yes**, via 'occurrence def CruiseControlInteraction'.\n- Nested InteractionTypes? **No**; there are no nested InteractionType elements, nor any structure that matches 28 levels of nested interaction types.\n\nSo, the generated model does **not** cover the specific structure of the reference model, which is a chain of nested InteractionType elements.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results.\n\n**Covered claims:**\n- The generated model is a SysML v2 model (1/1).\n- The generated model has an interaction (1/1).\n- The generated model does not have a 'System' element (0/1).\n- The generated model does not have any nested InteractionType elements (0/28).\n- The generated model does not have the specific containment relationships (0/30).\n\n**Total covered claims:**\n- 1 (SysML v2 model exists)\n- 1 (Interaction exists)\n\n**Total claims:** 61\n\n**Score:** 2/61\n\n---\n\n## Final Output\n\nScore: 2/61"

That Interaction contains another Interaction.\n5. ... and so on, for each level of nesting.\n\nTo count the number of atomic claims, we need to count the number of `<Interaction>` elements, plus the System and the SysMLModel.\n\nLet's count the number of `<Interaction>` elements.

Let's count them:\n\n- The first `<Interaction>` is at indentation 3.\n- The last line is `<Interaction`, which is the 30th (since the pattern is repeated 30 times).\n\nSo, the atomic claims are:\n\n1.

For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. **Requirement: The actual mass of the vehicle must not exceed a specified limit.**\n- **Covered?**  \n  - Yes. The generated model defines `MassLimitationRequirement` and `VehicleMassLimitationRequirement` with the constraint `massActual <= massReqd` and documentation matching the requirement.\n\n#### 2. **Constraint:**\n   - **If FuelTankFilled = true, then TotalVehicleMass <= 2000**\n   - **If FuelTankFilled = false, then TotalVehicleMass <= [likely 1500]**\n- **Covered?**  \n  - Yes. The generated model defines two requirements:\n    - `fullVehicleMassLimit` with `vehicle.fuelMass == vehicle.fuelFullMass` and `massReqd = 2000[kg]`\n    - `emptyVehicleMassLimit` with `vehicle.fuelMass == 0[kg]` and `massReqd = 1500[kg]`\n  - This matches the conditional constraints in the reference model.\n\n#### 3. **Variable/attribute representing whether the fuel tank is filled (FuelTankFilled: Boolean).**\n- **Covered?**  \n  - Partially. The generated model does not have a direct Boolean attribute `FuelTankFilled`, but instead uses `vehicle.fuelMass == vehicle.fuelFullMass` (full) and `vehicle.fuelMass == 0[kg]` (empty) to represent the same concept. This is semantically equivalent.\n\n#### 4. **Variable/attribute representing the total vehicle mass (TotalVehicleMass: Numeric).**\n- **Covered?**  \n  - Yes. The generated model defines `vehicle.dryMass + vehicle.fuelMass` as the total mass via `massActual = vehicle.dryMass + vehicle.fuelMass`.\n\n#### 5. **Variable/attribute representing the mass limit (likely 2000 or 1500, depending on fuel tank state).**\n- **Covered?**  \n  - Yes. The generated model uses `massReqd = 2000[kg]` and `massReqd = 1500[kg]` in the respective requirements.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The \"Vehicle\" component has an attribute \"mass\" of type \"double\".\n\n- **Generated model:** 'Vehicle' has an attribute 'mass', but its type is 'ISQ::mass', not 'double'.

The \"Vehicle\" component contains a component named \"FrontAxleAssembly\".\n\n- **Generated model:** In the 'Usages' package, 'vehicle1' (of type Vehicle) has a part 'frontAxleAssembly' of type 'AxleAssembly'. The naming is slightly different ('FrontAxleAssembly' vs 'AxleAssembly'), but in 'vehicle1_c1', 'frontAxleAssembly' contains a 'frontAxle' of type 'FrontAxle', which is a specialization. The structure is present, though the naming is not exact.\n- **Covered:** Yes (allowing for naming differences).\n\n#### 6. The \"FrontAxleAssembly\" component has an attribute \"mass\" of type \"double\".\n\n- **Generated model:** 'AxleAssembly' is defined as a part, but there is no attribute 'mass' in 'AxleAssembly'. There is an 'Axle' part with a 'mass' attribute, and 'FrontAxle' specializes 'Axle', but 'AxleAssembly' itself does not have a 'mass' attribute.\n- **Covered:** **No.**\n\n#### 7. The \"FrontAxleAssembly\" component contains a component named \"Wheel\".\n\n- **Generated model:** In 'vehicle1', 'frontAxleAssembly' contains 'frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered'.
