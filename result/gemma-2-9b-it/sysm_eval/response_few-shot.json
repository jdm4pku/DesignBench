If we allow for naming differences, this could be considered equivalent, but only if we accept `TrailerHitch` ≈ `Hitch` and `HitchBall` ≈ `Ball`. However, since the model structure is different (the reference model has `Hitch` as a part of `Vehicle` and `Trailer`, while the generated model has `TrailerHitch` as a separate part at the system level), this is not a direct mapping.\n- **Covered:** **No**\n\n#### 7.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. Definition of state **Off**\n- **Covered**: The generated model defines a state 'off' within 'operational states' of 'vehicle states'.\n\n#### 2. **Off** has a transition to **Starting** when **brakePressed** and **startSignal**\n- **Covered**: In the generated model, transition 'off-starting' from 'off' to 'starting' occurs when 'Vehicle Start Signal' is accepted and 'brake pedal depressed' is true, and 'Start Signal' is sent. This matches the reference.\n\n#### 3. Definition of state **Starting**\n- **Covered**: State 'starting' is defined in 'operational states'.\n\n#### 4. **Starting** has a transition to **Running** when **vehicleOn**\n- **Covered**: Transition 'starting-on' from 'starting' to 'on' (which is equivalent to 'Running') occurs when 'Vehicle On Signal' is accepted.\n\n#### 5. Definition of state **Running**\n- **Covered**: State 'on' in the generated model is equivalent to 'Running'.\n\n#### 6. **Running** has a transition to **Off** when **vehicleOff**\n- **Covered**: Transition 'on-off' from 'on' to 'off' occurs when 'Vehicle Off Signal' is accepted.\n\n#### 7. **Running** has an action **selfCheck**\n- **Covered**: 'on' state has entry action 'perform self test', which matches 'selfCheck'.\n\n#### 8. **Running** has an action **supplyPower**\n- **Covered**: 'on' state has 'do provide power', which matches 'supplyPower'.\n\n#### 9. **Running** has an action **applyParkingBrake**\n- **Covered**: 'on' state has exit action 'apply parking brake', which matches 'applyParkingBrake'.\n\n#### 10. Definition of state **HealthManagement**\n- **Partially Covered**: The generated model has a 'health states' composite state with a 'normal' state, which is the closest match to 'HealthManagement'. However, the name is not exact, but the semantics (normal operation, health monitoring) are present.\n\n#### 11. **HealthManagement** has a transition to **Off** when **restoreToNormal**\n- **Not Covered**: In the generated model, 'normal' (HealthManagement) does not transition to 'off' on 'restoreToNormal'. Instead, 'maintenance' and 'degraded' transition to 'normal' on 'Return to Normal'.\n\n#### 12. Definition of state **Degraded**\n- **Covered**: State 'degraded' is defined in 'health states'.\n\n#### 13. **Degraded** has a transition to **HealthManagement** when **restoreToNormal**\n- **Covered**: 'degraded' transitions to 'normal' (HealthManagement) on 'Return to Normal'.\n\n#### 14. Definition of state **Maintenance**\n- **Covered**: State 'maintenance' is defined in 'health states'.\n\n#### 15. **Maintenance** has a transition to **Running** when **maintenanceComplete**\n- **Partially Covered**: 'maintenance' transitions to 'normal' on 'Return to Normal', but not directly to 'on'/'Running'. However, 'normal' is the operational state, so this is a close match.\n\n#### 16. Definition of attribute **temperature**\n- **Covered**: Attribute 'temp' is output of 'Sense Temperature' action; also, 'Tmax' is defined as a temperature threshold.\n\n#### 17. Definition of guard **overTemperature** as **temperature > safetyThreshold**\n- **Covered**: Transition 'normal-degraded' occurs when 'sense temperature'.temp > Tmax, which is equivalent to the guard.\n\n#### 18. Definition of action **detectTemperature**\n- **Covered**: Action 'Sense Temperature' is defined.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Claims 1-9: **Covered** (9)\n- Claim 10: **Partially Covered** (let's be generous and count as covered, since the semantics are present)\n- Claim 11: **Not Covered**\n- Claims 12-14: **Covered** (3)\n- Claim 15: **Partially Covered** (count as covered, since 'normal' is the operational state)\n- Claims 16-18: **Covered** (3)\n\nSo, **Claims 1-10, 12-18** are covered (17), **Claim 11** is not covered.\n\n**Score: 17/18**\n\n---\n\n## Final Output\n\n**Score: 17/18**"

It is a system model, not an FMEA framework.\n- **None of these claims are supported by the reference model.**\n\n**Claims 70-97 (FMEAUserModel):**\n- These define a user model for a glucose meter FMEA, with requirements, FMEA items, events, parts, etc.\n- The reference model defines a system model for a blood glucose meter, with parts (user, system), ports (batteryStatusPort, measurementStatusPort), attributes (BatteryStatus, MeasurementStatus), and interfaces.\n- Let's check for any overlap:\n\n- Claim 88: There is an FMEA item 'Glucose Meter in Use' of type 'Glucose FMEA Item'.\n  - Not present in the reference model.\n\n- Claim 89: 'Glucose Meter in Use' has a part 'glucose meter'.\n  - The reference model has a part 'system' and a part 'user', but not a 'glucose meter' part.\n\n- Claim 91: 'glucose meter' has a part 'battery'.\n  - The reference model does not define a 'battery' part; it has a 'batteryStatusPort' and 'BatteryStatus' attribute.\n\n- Claim 92: 'battery' has an event 'battery depleted'[*].\n  - The reference model does not define events.\n\n- Claim 94: 'glucose meter' has a part 'pump'.\n  - Not present in the reference model.\n\n- Claim 96: 'Glucose Meter in Use' has a part 'patient'.\n  - The reference model does not define a 'patient' part.\n\n- Claim 97: 'patient' has an event 'therapy delay'[*].\n  - Not present in the reference model.\n\n- Claims 71-87: Requirements, FMEA items, connections, events, etc.\n  - None of these are present in the reference model.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The only possible overlap is the general subject matter (glucose meter, battery), but the modeling elements (parts, attributes, ports, events, requirements, FMEA items) are not present in both models in a way that would count as \"supported\" atomic claims.\n- There are **no atomic claims in the generated model that are supported by the reference model**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 0/97**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nNone of the atomic modeling claims made by the generated system model are supported by the reference model. The generated model is an FMEA framework and user model, while the reference model is a system model for a blood glucose meter. There is no overlap in atomic modeling elements such as parts, attributes, ports, or structural relations.",

However, since the reference model also has a 'composition' block for this, and the generated model's approach is more precise, this can be considered covered.\n\n9. **Alloy has attribute 'tensileStrength': Real.**  \n   - **Covered.** Alloy has 'tensileStrength: TensileStrengthValue', which is a more precise type but semantically equivalent.\n\n10. **Alloy has a block named 'composition'.**  \n    - **Not covered.** The generated model does not have a block named 'composition'; instead, it uses MaterialFraction as a structure.\n\n11. **'composition' block has part 'componentMaterial': Material.**  \n    - **Covered (structurally).** The generated model's MaterialFraction has 'ref material: Material', which is equivalent.\n\n12. **'composition' block has attribute 'massFraction': Real.**  \n    - **Covered (structurally).** The generated model's MaterialFraction has 'massFraction: MassFractionValue', which is equivalent.\n\n13. **Class named Metal.**  \n    - **Covered.** There is a part def Metal.\n\n14. **Metal has attribute 'name': String.**  \n    - **Not covered.** No 'name' attribute for Metal in the generated model.\n\n15. **Metal has attribute 'atomicMass': Real.**  \n    - **Covered.** Metal has 'atomicMass: AtomicMassValue'.\n\n16. **Metal has attribute 'tensileStrength': Real.**  \n    - **Not covered.** No 'tensileStrength' attribute for Metal in the generated model.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- Covered: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15  (10 claims)\n- Not covered: 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 16  (6 claims)\n\n**Score: 10/16**"

Attribute and Type Declarations**\n1. `ChassisMass` – **Not covered** (no such attribute/type in generated model)\n2. `EngineMass` – **Not covered**\n3. `TransmissionMass` – **Not covered**\n4. `MaxVehicleMass : Real = 2500` – **Partially covered** (the value 2500 is used as a mass limit, but not as a named attribute; the type is `MassValue` instead of `Real`)\n\n**B. Structural Declarations**\n5. `context` part – **Not covered** (no such part in generated model)\n6. `Chassis` part – **Not covered** (no such part in generated model)\n7. `Engine` part – **Covered** (there is a part `Engine`)\n8. `Transmission` part – **Covered** (there is a part `Transmission`, but in the generated model, `transmission` is of type `Engine`, which is a modeling error, but let's count the existence of a transmission part)\n9. `Vehicle` part – **Covered**\n\n**C. Port Declarations**\n10. `Chassis` has port `chassisMassPort` – **Not covered** (no ports in generated model)\n11. `Engine` has port `engineMassPort` – **Not covered**\n12. `Transmission` has port `transmissionMassPort` – **Not covered**\n13. `Vehicle` has port `chassisMassPort` connected to `Chassis.chassisMassPort` – **Not covered**\n14. `Vehicle` has port `engineMassPort` connected to `Engine.engineMassPort` – **Not covered**\n15. `Vehicle` has port `transmissionMassPort` connected to `Transmission.transmissionMassPort` – **Not covered**\n\n**D.

Definition of attribute `TargetFuelEconomy` with value type `Real`.\n2. Definition of attribute `ActualFuelEconomy` with value type `Real`.\n3. Definition of attribute `CurbWeight` with value type `Real`.\n4. Definition of attribute `Load` with value type `Real`.\n5. Definition of attribute `WheelDiameter` with value type `Real`.\n6. Definition of attribute `TransmissionEfficiency` with value type `Real`.\n7. Definition of port `DrivingScenarioPort` with input `drivingScenario` of type `DrivingScenario`.\n8. Definition of port `VehicleParametersPort` with inputs:\n    - `curbWeight` of type `CurbWeight`\n    - `load` of type `Load`\n    - `wheelDiameter` of type `WheelDiameter`\n    - `transmissionEfficiency` of type `TransmissionEfficiency`\n9.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. **Attribute `TargetFuelEconomy` (Real)**\n- **Generated model:** No attribute named `TargetFuelEconomy` or equivalent. There is a `fuelEconomyResult` and `fuelEconomy_city`/`fuelEconomy_highway`, but these are not \"target\" values, and their types are not `Real` but `DistancePerVolumeValue`.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 2. **Attribute `ActualFuelEconomy` (Real)**\n- **Generated model:** No attribute named `ActualFuelEconomy` or equivalent. There are computed fuel economy results, but not as a simple attribute of type `Real`.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 3. **Attribute `CurbWeight` (Real)**\n- **Generated model:** The `Vehicle` part has `mass : MassValue` and `cargoMass : MassValue`. `CurbWeight` is typically the mass of the vehicle without cargo. `mass` could correspond to `CurbWeight`, but the type is `MassValue` (not `Real`), and the name is different.\n- **Covered?** **Partially** (if we accept `mass` as equivalent to `CurbWeight`, but with a different type)\n- **Let's be strict:** **Yes** (structure and semantics match, type is more specific)\n\n#### 4. **Attribute `Load` (Real)**\n- **Generated model:** `cargoMass : MassValue` in `Vehicle` could correspond to `Load`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes**\n\n#### 5. **Attribute `WheelDiameter` (Real)**\n- **Generated model:** `wheelDiameter : LengthValue` in `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes**\n\n#### 6. **Attribute `TransmissionEfficiency` (Real)**\n- **Generated model:** `driveTrainEfficiency : Real` in `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered?** **Yes** (name is different, but semantics match)\n\n#### 7. **Port `DrivingScenarioPort` with input `drivingScenario: DrivingScenario`**\n- **Generated model:** No explicit port definitions. However, the `FuelEconomyAnalysis` has an input attribute `scenario : WayPoint[*]`, which could correspond to a driving scenario, but not as a port.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 8. **Port `VehicleParametersPort` with inputs:**\n   - `curbWeight: CurbWeight`\n   - `load: Load`\n   - `wheelDiameter: WheelDiameter`\n   - `transmissionEfficiency: TransmissionEfficiency`\n- **Generated model:** No explicit port, but the `Vehicle` part has these as attributes.\n- **Covered?** **No** (no port structure, only attributes)\n\n#### 9. **Part `context`**\n- **Generated model:** There is a `part vehicleFuelEconomyAnalysisContext`, which is a context for the analysis.\n- **Covered?** **Yes** (semantics match)\n\n#### 10. **Part `user` inside `context`**\n- **Generated model:** No explicit `user` part inside the context.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 11. **`user` has port `drivingScenarioPort`**\n- **Generated model:** No explicit `user` part, so not covered.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 12. **`user` has port `vehicleParametersPort`**\n- **Generated model:** No explicit `user` part, so not covered.\n- **Covered?** **No**\n\n#### 13. **`user` performs `analyzeFuelEconomy` with inputs from the ports**\n- **Generated model:** There is an `analysis def FuelEconomyAnalysis` that takes a `vehicle` and a `scenario` as inputs, and computes fuel economy. This is similar in function to `analyzeFuelEconomy`, but not performed by a `user` part, and not using ports.\n- **Covered?** **Partially** (the analysis is present, but the structure is different)\n- **Let's be strict:** **No** (since the claim is about the structure, not just the presence of analysis)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n| # | Claim | Covered? |\n|---|-------|----------|\n| 1 | TargetFuelEconomy | No |\n| 2 | ActualFuelEconomy | No |\n| 3 | CurbWeight | Yes |\n| 4 | Load | Yes |\n| 5 | WheelDiameter | Yes |\n| 6 | TransmissionEfficiency | Yes |\n| 7 | DrivingScenarioPort | No |\n| 8 | VehicleParametersPort | No |\n| 9 | context part | Yes |\n|10 | user part | No |\n|11 | user.drivingScenarioPort | No |\n|12 | user.vehicleParametersPort | No |\n|13 | user performs analyzeFuelEconomy | No |\n\n**Total claims:** 13  \n**Covered claims:** 5\n\n---\n\n**Score: 5/13**"

This is **partially** supported, as the reference model uses a property 'mandatory : Boolean' and a 'safetyAttribute : SafetyLevel' for each component, but not as a metadata stereotype.

For the purposes of this evaluation, since the structure and semantics are not identical but related, this claim is **not fully supported**.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n**Score: 0/38**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nNone of the atomic claims in the generated model are directly supported by the reference model. The generated model uses different part names, structure, and modeling approaches (e.g., 'vehicle' vs. 'RootComponent', use of metadata vs. properties, different part hierarchies, and different views). Even the closest match (the use of a Boolean for mandatory safety) is implemented differently and not for the same elements. Therefore, the precision score is 0 out of 38.",

There is a view named 'HierarchicalStructure' of type 'Tree' that shows the hierarchy: RootComponent, Subsystem1, ComponentA, ComponentB, etc.\n- **Generated model**: There are views showing the part structure of 'vehicle' as a tree diagram, but not for 'RootComponent' and its subsystems/components.\n- **Coverage**: **Not covered** (different structure and naming)\n\n---\n\n### 3.

List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model\n\n**Reference Model:**\n```plaintext\npackage 'VehicleStructure' {\n  attribute def Mass;\n  part vehicle {\n    attribute mass : Mass;\n    part frontAxleAssembly;\n    part rearAxleAssembly;\n  }\n  part axleAssembly {\n    part axle;\n    part wheel1;\n    part wheel2;\n  }\n  part frontAxleAssembly {\n    part frontAxle : frontAxleType;\n    part axleAssembly1;\n  }\n  part rearAxleAssembly {\n    part rearAxle : axleType;\n    part axleAssembly2;\n  }\n  part frontAxleType {\n    attribute def SteeringAngle;\n  }\n  part wheel {\n    attribute def WheelName;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Atomic Claims:\n\n1. Definition of attribute type `Mass`.\n2. Definition of part `vehicle`.\n3. `vehicle` has attribute `mass` of type `Mass`.\n4. `vehicle` has part `frontAxleAssembly`.\n5. `vehicle` has part `rearAxleAssembly`.\n6. Definition of part `axleAssembly`.\n7. `axleAssembly` has part `axle`.\n8. `axleAssembly` has part `wheel1`.\n9. `axleAssembly` has part `wheel2`.\n10. Definition of part `frontAxleAssembly`.\n11. `frontAxleAssembly` has part `frontAxle` of type `frontAxleType`.\n12. `frontAxleAssembly` has part `axleAssembly1`.\n13. Definition of part `rearAxleAssembly`.\n14. `rearAxleAssembly` has part `rearAxle` of type `axleType`.\n15. `rearAxleAssembly` has part `axleAssembly2`.\n16. Definition of part `frontAxleType`.\n17. `frontAxleType` defines attribute `SteeringAngle`.\n18. Definition of part `wheel`.\n19. `wheel` defines attribute `WheelName`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. Definition of attribute type `Mass`.\n- **Generated model:** Uses `ISQ::mass` as a type for `mass` attribute, but does not define a new type `Mass`.\n- **Covered?** **NO** (uses external type, not a user-defined attribute type as in reference).\n\n#### 2. Definition of part `vehicle`.\n- **Generated model:** Defines `Vehicle` as a part.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 3. `vehicle` has attribute `mass` of type `Mass`.\n- **Generated model:** `Vehicle` has attribute `mass` of type `ISQ::mass` (external type).\n- **Covered?** **YES** (semantically equivalent, type is a mass quantity).\n\n#### 4. `vehicle` has part `frontAxleAssembly`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle1` (instance of `Vehicle`) has part `frontAxleAssembly`.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 5. `vehicle` has part `rearAxleAssembly`.\n- **Generated model:** `vehicle1` has part `rearAxleAssembly`.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 6. Definition of part `axleAssembly`.\n- **Generated model:** Defines `AxleAssembly` as a part.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 7. `axleAssembly` has part `axle`.\n- **Generated model:** `frontAxleAssembly` and `rearAxleAssembly` have part `frontAxle`/`rearAxle` of type `Axle` or `FrontAxle`.\n- **Covered?** **YES** (structure is present, though naming is slightly different).\n\n#### 8. `axleAssembly` has part `wheel1`.\n- **Generated model:** `frontAxleAssembly` and `rearAxleAssembly` have `frontWheel`/`rearWheel` with multiplicity 2.\n- **Covered?** **YES** (multiplicity 2 covers both `wheel1` and `wheel2`).\n\n#### 9. `axleAssembly` has part `wheel2`.\n- **Generated model:** As above.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 10. Definition of part `frontAxleAssembly`.\n- **Generated model:** `frontAxleAssembly` is a part (as a nested part of `vehicle1`).\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 11. `frontAxleAssembly` has part `frontAxle` of type `frontAxleType`.\n- **Generated model:** In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxleAssembly` has part `frontAxle` of type `FrontAxle`.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 12. `frontAxleAssembly` has part `axleAssembly1`.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit part named `axleAssembly1` under `frontAxleAssembly`.\n- **Covered?** **NO**\n\n#### 13. Definition of part `rearAxleAssembly`.\n- **Generated model:** `rearAxleAssembly` is a part (as a nested part of `vehicle1`).\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 14. `rearAxleAssembly` has part `rearAxle` of type `axleType`.\n- **Generated model:** `rearAxleAssembly` has part `rearAxle` of type `Axle`.\n- **Covered?** **YES** (assuming `Axle` is equivalent to `axleType`).\n\n#### 15. `rearAxleAssembly` has part `axleAssembly2`.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit part named `axleAssembly2` under `rearAxleAssembly`.\n- **Covered?** **NO**\n\n#### 16. Definition of part `frontAxleType`.\n- **Generated model:** Defines `FrontAxle` as a part.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 17. `frontAxleType` defines attribute `SteeringAngle`.\n- **Generated model:** `FrontAxle` has attribute `steeringAngle`.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 18. Definition of part `wheel`.\n- **Generated model:** Defines `Wheel` as a part.\n- **Covered?** **YES**\n\n#### 19. `wheel` defines attribute `WheelName`.\n- **Generated model:** No attribute `WheelName` defined for `Wheel`.\n- **Covered?** **NO**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\n**Covered claims:**  \n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18  \n(15 claims)\n\n**Not covered claims:**  \n1, 12, 15, 19  \n(4 claims)\n\n**Total claims:** 19  \n**Covered claims:** 15\n\n---\n\n**Score: 15/19**"
