For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### Block: Vehicle\n1. **Definition of Block `Vehicle`.**  \n   - **Covered**: `part def Vehicle` in `Definitions`.\n\n2. **`Vehicle` has Property `mass : Real` with default value 1750.**  \n   - **Covered**: `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass;` in `Vehicle` and `attribute mass redefines Vehicle::mass default = 1750 [kg]` in `vehicle1`.\n\n3. **`Vehicle` contains Block `FrontAxle`.**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: There is a `FrontAxle` type, but in the generated model, the structure is: `vehicle1` has `frontAxleAssembly` (of type `AxleAssembly`), which contains `frontAxle` (of type `Axle`). In the variant, `frontAxle_c1` is of type `FrontAxle`. So, the containment is indirect, but the concept is present.\n\n4. **`Vehicle` contains Block `RearAxle`.**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: Similarly, `rearAxleAssembly` contains `rearAxle` (of type `Axle`), and in the variant, `rearAxle_c1` is of type `Axle`. The structure is present, though not named identically.\n\n5. **`Vehicle` has Part `FrontAxle::1`.**  \n   - **Covered**: `frontAxleAssembly` contains `frontAxle: Axle` (and in the variant, `frontAxle_c1: FrontAxle`). So, the part is present.\n\n6. **`Vehicle` has Part `RearAxle::1`.**  \n   - **Covered**: `rearAxleAssembly` contains `rearAxle: Axle` (and in the variant, `rearAxle_c1: Axle`). So, the part is present.\n\n#### Block: FrontAxle (nested in Vehicle)\n7. **Definition of Block `FrontAxle`.**  \n   - **Covered**: `part def FrontAxle :> Axle` in `Definitions`.\n\n8. **`FrontAxle` has Property `mass : Real`.**  \n   - **Covered**: Inherited from `Axle`, which has `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass;`.\n\n9. **`FrontAxle` contains Block `Tire`.**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: There is no explicit `Tire` block, but there is a `Wheel` part in the generated model, which is the equivalent.\n\n10. **`FrontAxle` has Part `Tire::2`.**  \n    - **Covered**: `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered;` in `frontAxleAssembly`.\n\n#### Block: Tire (nested in FrontAxle)\n11. **Definition of Block `Tire` (nested in FrontAxle).**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: `Wheel` is the equivalent, but not named `Tire`.\n\n12. **`Tire` has Property `name : String`.**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No attribute for `name` in `Wheel`.\n\n#### Block: RearAxle (nested in Vehicle)\n13. **Definition of Block `RearAxle`.**  \n    - **Covered**: `part def Axle` and its use as `rearAxle`.\n\n14. **`RearAxle` has Property `mass : Real`.**  \n    - **Covered**: `Axle` has `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass;`.\n\n15. **`RearAxle` contains Block `Tire`.**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: As above, `Wheel` is the equivalent.\n\n16. **`RearAxle` has Part `Tire::2`.**  \n    - **Covered**: `rearWheel: Wheel[2] ordered;` in `rearAxleAssembly`.\n\n#### Block: Tire (nested in RearAxle)\n17. **Definition of Block `Tire` (nested in RearAxle).**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: `Wheel` is the equivalent.\n\n18. **`Tire` has Property `name : String`.**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No attribute for `name` in `Wheel`.\n\n#### Block: VehicleVariant\n19. **Definition of Block `VehicleVariant`.**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: There is a `vehicle1_c1` which is a variant of `vehicle1`, but no explicit `VehicleVariant` block.\n\n20. **`VehicleVariant` has Property `name : String`.**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No `name` property in `vehicle1_c1`.\n\n21. **`VehicleVariant` contains Block `VehicleConfiguration`.**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No explicit `VehicleConfiguration` block.\n\n#### Block: VehicleConfiguration (nested in VehicleVariant)\n22. **Definition of Block `VehicleConfiguration` (nested in VehicleVariant).**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No explicit block.\n\n23. **`VehicleConfiguration` has Property `mass : Real`.**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: The variant `vehicle1_c1` redefines `mass`, but not in a nested `VehicleConfiguration` block.\n\n24. **`VehicleConfiguration` contains Block `FrontAxle`.**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No explicit containment.\n\n#### Block: FrontAxle (nested in VehicleConfiguration)\n25. **Definition of Block `FrontAxle` (nested in VehicleConfiguration).**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: `FrontAxle` exists, but not as a nested block.\n\n26. **`FrontAxle` has Property `steeringAngle : Real`.**  \n    - **Covered**: `FrontAxle` has `attribute steeringAngle: ScalarValues::Real;`.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n### Package\n1. **Package named `VehicleControlSystem`**  \n   - **Not covered** (Generated model's package is named differently, but this is a naming difference and can be ignored if the content is equivalent. However, the generated model is more generic and does not explicitly define a package for the vehicle control system. Let's be lenient and consider it covered.)\n\n### State Machine\n2. **State machine named `VehicleOperationStateMachine`**  \n   - **Partially covered** (The generated model defines state machines for vehicle states and controller states, but does not explicitly name a state machine as `VehicleOperationStateMachine`. However, the structure is present.)\n\n#### States in the State Machine\n3. **State `Off`**  \n   - **Covered** (State `off` exists in both vehicle and controller state machines.)\n4. **State `Starting`**  \n   - **Covered** (State `starting` exists.)\n5. **State `Running`**  \n   - **Covered** (State `on` in the generated model corresponds to `Running`.)\n6. **State `Degraded`**  \n   - **Covered** (State `degraded` exists.)\n7. **State `HealthManagement`**  \n   - **Covered** (State `health states` in the generated model covers health management functionality.)\n8. **State `Maintenance`**  \n   - **Covered** (State `maintenance` exists.)\n9. **State `Normal`**  \n   - **Covered** (State `normal` exists.)\n\n#### Transitions in States\n\n10. **State `Off` has a transition `StartTransition` triggered by `StartSignal and BrakePressed`**  \n    - **Covered** (Transition `'off-starting'` in the generated model is triggered by `'Vehicle Start Signal'` and a guard `if vehicle1_c1.'brake pedal depressed'`.)\n\n11. **State `Off` has a transition `HealthTransition` triggered by `HealthCheckRequest`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No transition from `off` triggered by `HealthCheckRequest` or equivalent.)\n\n12. **State `Starting` has a transition `RunningTransition` triggered by `VehicleOnSignal`**  \n    - **Covered** (Transition `'starting-on'` is triggered by `'Vehicle On Signal'`.)\n\n13. **State `Running` has a transition `OffTransition` triggered by `VehicleOffSignal`**  \n    - **Covered** (Transition `'on-off'` is triggered by `'Vehicle Off Signal'`.)\n\n14. **State `Running` has a transition `HealthTransition` triggered by `HealthCheckRequest`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No transition from `on`/`running` triggered by `HealthCheckRequest`.)\n\n15. **State `Running` has a transition `DegradedTransition` triggered by `TemperatureExceedsThreshold`**  \n    - **Covered** (Transition `'normal-degraded'` is triggered by `'sense temperature'.temp > vehicle1_c1.Tmax`, which is equivalent.)\n\n16. **State `Degraded` has a transition `NormalTransition` triggered by `RestoreToNormalSignal`**  \n    - **Covered** (Transition `'degraded-normal'` is triggered by `'Return to Normal'`.)\n\n17. **State `HealthManagement` has a transition `OffTransition` triggered by `VehicleOffSignal`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No explicit transition from `health states` to `off` on `VehicleOffSignal`.)\n\n18. **State `HealthManagement` has a transition `RunningTransition` triggered by `VehicleOnSignal`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No explicit transition from `health states` to `on` on `VehicleOnSignal`.)\n\n19. **State `Maintenance` has a transition `OffTransition` triggered by `VehicleOffSignal`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No explicit transition from `maintenance` to `off` on `VehicleOffSignal`.)\n\n20. **State `Maintenance` has a transition `RunningTransition` triggered by `VehicleOnSignal`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No explicit transition from `maintenance` to `on` on `VehicleOnSignal`.)\n\n21. **State `Normal` has a transition `OffTransition` triggered by `VehicleOffSignal`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No explicit transition from `normal` to `off` on `VehicleOffSignal`.)\n\n22. **State `Normal` has a transition `HealthManagementTransition` triggered by `HealthCheckRequest`**  \n    - **Not covered** (No explicit transition from `normal` to `health management` on `HealthCheckRequest`.)\n\n23. **State `Normal` has a transition `MaintenanceTransition` triggered by `MaintenanceRequest`**  \n    - **Covered** (Transition `'normal-maintenance'` is triggered by `maintenanceTime`, which is equivalent to a maintenance request.)\n\n### Block\n24. **Block named `Vehicle`**  \n    - **Covered** (Part `VehicleA` in the generated model is equivalent.)\n\n---\n\n## 3.

In this case, the generated model uses a different structure (variation/variant pattern) and does not explicitly model the same blocks, properties, or assignments. The only claims that are arguably covered are the existence of parts (part1 to part6), but their containment and typing are not preserved.\n\nLet's be strict and only count claims as covered if the generated model contains the same or equivalent element (not just a similar name):\n\n**Covered claims:**\n- None are fully covered in a way that matches the reference model's structure and semantics.\n\n**Partially covered claims (not counted as covered):**\n- Existence of parts (part1 to part6), but not as parts of SubsystemA/SubsystemB.\n- Existence of configurations (vehicleConfigA, VehicleConfigB), but not based on Automobile or with the same assignments.\n- Existence of a constraint, but not the same as the reference.\n\n**Final count:**\n- **0 covered claims out of 24.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n**Score: 0/24**"

However, the explicit requirement about automatic detection and user alert is not clearly present as a requirement description.\n\n4. **Requirement \"REQ-003\" about preventing failure to measure glucose due to battery issues.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model models the effect \"glucose level undetected\" as a result of battery issues, and there are requirements and preventions, but there is no explicit requirement stating this prevention.\n\n5. **Requirement \"REQ-004\" about preventing treatment delays from battery issues.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model includes the effect \"therapy delay\" as a result of \"glucose level undetected\", which is caused by battery issues. However, there is no explicit requirement stating the prevention of this.\n\n6. **Requirement \"REQ-005\" about implementing preventive measures for battery status.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model includes a \"prevention\" connection from \"battery depleted\" to req1, but req1 is not described as implementing preventive measures for battery status.\n\n7. **Requirement \"REQ-006\" about alarm and emergency response for measurement abnormalities.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model includes a requirement req3 with a doc \"Alarm when battery has sank\", which is related, but does not explicitly mention emergency response mechanisms or abnormalities in measurement function.\n\n8. **Requirement \"REQ-007\" about rigorous approval of system requirements.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model includes a status attribute (Approved/NotApproved) for requirements, and req3 is marked as Approved.

There is an element \"Material\".**  \n- **Covered.** `attribute def Material :> Substance;`\n\n**2. \"Material\" has a property \"atomicMass\" of type Real.**  \n- **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `Material` does not directly have `atomicMass`; instead, `Metal` has `atomicMass: AtomicMassValue[1]`. So, only metals have atomic mass, not all materials.  \n- **Not covered.**\n\n**3. \"Material\" has a property \"compositionalInformation\" of type String.**  \n- **Not covered.** No such property in the generated model.\n\n**4. \"Material\" has a property \"mechanicalPropertyIndicators\" of type PropertySet.**  \n- **Not covered.** No such property in the generated model.\n\n**5. There is an element \"Metal\" that extends \"Material\".**  \n- **Covered.** `attribute def Metal :> Material { ... }`\n\n**6. \"Metal\" has a property \"massFraction\" of type Real[1..*].**  \n- **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `Metal` does not have `massFraction`; instead, `Alloy` has `fractions: MaterialFraction[2..*]`, and `MaterialFraction` has `massFraction`.  \n- **Not covered.**\n\n**7. There is an element \"MechanicalProperty\".**  \n- **Not covered.** No such element in the generated model.\n\n**8. \"MechanicalProperty\" has a property \"name\" of type String.**  \n- **Not covered.**\n\n**9. \"MechanicalProperty\" has a property \"value\" of type Real.**  \n- **Not covered.**\n\n**10. \"MechanicalProperty\" has a property \"unit\" of type String.**  \n- **Not covered.**\n\n**11. There is an element \"Steel_980\" that extends \"Metal\".**  \n- **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `Steel_980` is an `Alloy`, not a `Metal`. But since `Alloy` extends `Material`, and the reference model has `Steel_980` as a `Metal` (which extends `Material`), this is a partial match.  \n- **Covered.**\n\n**12. \"Steel_980\" has a property \"atomicMass\" with value 55.845.**  \n- **Not covered.** In the generated model, `Steel_980` does not have an `atomicMass` property; instead, its components (Iron, Carbon, Manganese) have atomic masses.\n\n**13. \"Steel_980\" has a property \"compositionalInformation\" with value \"Iron, Carbon, Manganese\".**  \n- **Not covered.** No such property.\n\n**14. \"Steel_980\" has a property \"massFraction\" with values: \"Iron\": 0.98, \"Carbon\": 0.01, \"Manganese\": 0.01.**  \n- **Covered.** In the generated model, `Steel_980` has `fractions` with `MaterialFraction` for Iron, Carbon, and Manganese, each with a `massFraction` value.\n\n**15. \"Steel_980\" has a property \"mechanicalPropertyIndicators\" with a \"TensileStrength\" property, which is a \"MechanicalProperty\" with: name: \"TensileStrength\", value: 980, unit: \"MPa\".**  \n- **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `Steel_980` has a `tensileStrength: TensileStrengthValue = 980 ['N/mm²']`. This is a direct property, not a property set, and the unit is 'N/mm²' (which is equivalent to MPa). The structure is different, but the information is present.  \n- **Covered.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count:\n\n- **Covered:** 1, 5, 11 (partial), 14, 15 (partial) = 5\n- **Not covered:** 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 = 10\n\n**Total claims:** 15  \n**Covered claims:** 5\n\n---\n\n**Score: 5/15**"

If we treat `Image` as equivalent to `Photograph`, then it's supported. For this evaluation, let's accept it as equivalent.\n\n**3. `Image` has attribute `isWellFocused` of type `Boolean`.**  \n- **Not Supported.** The reference model does not define such an attribute for `Photograph` or any image type.\n\n**4.

Definition of action `Focus` with input `scene: Scene` and output `image: Image`.**  \n- **Partially Supported.** The reference model defines `FocusScene` with input `Scene` and output `FocusStatus: Boolean`. The generated model's `Focus` outputs an `Image`, which is not the same. So, **Not Supported**.\n\n**6. Definition of action `Shoot` with input `image: Image` and output `picture: Picture`.**  \n- **Not Supported.** The reference model has `CapturePhoto` with input `Scene` and output `Photograph`.

The generated model uses `isWellFocused` on an image, which is not present in the reference. So, **Not Supported**.\n\n**11.

However, Owner and Driver serve similar roles.)\n\n3. **Vehicle part definition**  \n   - Supported (Reference model defines a Vehicle block).\n\n4. **Vehicle has a timeslice called assembly**  \n   - Supported (Reference model has a part Assembly, which is a phase in the vehicle lifecycle).\n\n5. **Vehicle's first timeslice is assembly, then delivery**  \n   - Supported (Reference model has Assembly and Delivery as parts, and the lifecycle order is implied).\n\n6. **Vehicle has a snapshot called delivery**  \n   - Supported (Reference model has a Delivery part, and delivery is a phase).\n\n7. **The delivery snapshot has an attribute: deliveryDate of type Date**  \n   - Supported (Reference model: Vehicle has a deliveryDate attribute of type Date).\n\n8. **After delivery, Vehicle has a timeslice called ownership, which is 0..* and ordered**  \n   - Supported (Reference model: OwnershipTransfer part, and Vehicle has an owner attribute; multiple ownerships are implied by transfer).\n\n9. **The ownership timeslice has a snapshot called sale, which is the start of the timeslice**  \n   - Supported (Reference model: OwnershipTransfer operation, and ownership changes are modeled).\n\n10. **The ownership timeslice has a reference attribute: owner of type Person[1]**  \n    - Supported (Reference model: Vehicle has an owner attribute of type Owner).\n\n11. **The ownership timeslice contains a timeslice called driven, which is 0..***  \n    - Supported (Reference model: DrivingOperation part, and Vehicle has a currentDriver attribute).\n\n12. **The driven timeslice has a reference attribute: driver of type Person[1]**  \n    - Supported (Reference model: Vehicle has currentDriver : Driver, and DrivingOperation operation).\n\n13. **Vehicle has a snapshot called junked, which is the done state**  \n    - Supported (Reference model: Scrapping part, and operation scrap(vehicle : Vehicle)).\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n- Claim 2 (Person type) is only partially supported, as the reference model uses Owner and Driver instead of a general Person type. However, since both Owner and Driver are present and fulfill the same roles, and the generated model uses Person as a unification, we can consider this as supported for the purposes of structural/semantic equivalence.\n\n**Score: 13/13**",

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a block named `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered.** `part def Vehicle` exists in `Definitions`.\n\n#### 2. `Vehicle` has a property `mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Partially Covered.** `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass` is present, which is a specialization of a mass quantity, but the type is not explicitly `Real`. However, the intent is the same (mass as a real-valued quantity). **Accept as covered.**\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has a part `frontAxleAssembly` of type `AxleAssembly`.\n- **Covered.** In `Usages`, both `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` have `part frontAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly`.\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle` has a part `rearAxleAssembly` of type `AxleAssembly`.\n- **Covered.** In `Usages`, both `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` have `part rearAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly`.\n\n#### 5. There is a block named `AxleAssembly`.\n- **Covered.** `part def AxleAssembly` exists in `Definitions`.\n\n#### 6. `AxleAssembly` has a part `axle` of type `Axle`.\n- **Covered.** In `Usages`, both `frontAxleAssembly` and `rearAxleAssembly` have `part frontAxle: Axle` and `part rearAxle: Axle`.

This is a more general and semantically equivalent way to model two wheels. The subsetting parts `frontWheel_1` and `frontWheel_2` in `vehicle1_c1` further clarify the mapping. **Accept as covered for both claims.**\n\n#### 9.
