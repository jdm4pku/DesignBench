Relationship `ConnectsTo` from `Bead` to `Rim`\n- **Covered.** The `PressureSeat` connection: `end bead : TireBead[1]; end mountingRim : TireMountingRim[1];` and its use in the model (`connection : PressureSeat connect bead references t.bead to mountingRim references w.rim;`) covers this relationship.\n\n#### 13. Relationship `ConnectsTo` from `Rim` to `Hub`\n- **Not covered.** No explicit connection or containment from `TireMountingRim` (Rim) to `Hub`.\n\n#### 14. Relationship `ConnectsTo` from `Hub` to `BoltMountingHole`\n- **Covered.** There is a connection: `connect lugBoltJoints[0..1] to wheel.w.mountingHoles[1]; connect lugBoltJoints[0..1] to hub.h[1];` which links `LugBoltJoint` (BoltConnection) to both `mountingHoles` (BoltMountingHole) and `h` (ThreadedHole).

Definition of block `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered**: `part def Vehicle` exists in the generated model.\n\n#### 2. `Vehicle` has property `Mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered**: `attribute mass: MassValue;` and in usages, `mass = 2000 [kg]` etc. While the type is `MassValue` (likely a Real with units), this is equivalent.\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has property `FuelStatus` of type `String`.\n- **Partially Covered**: The generated model has `fuelLevel: Real` and `fuelTankCapacity: Real`, but not a `FuelStatus` of type `String`. The concept of fuel status is present, but the type and naming differ. The requirement constraints use `fuelLevel` and `fuelTankCapacity` to express fuel status, which is a more precise modeling. **We will consider this covered, as the semantics are present, though the type is more precise.**\n\n#### 4. Definition of block `Engine`.\n- **Covered**: `part def Engine` exists.\n\n#### 5. `Engine` has property `Torque` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered**: There is no direct `torque: Real` attribute, but there is an action `'generate torque'` and requirements referencing torque generation. The concept is modeled as an action rather than a property, but the semantics are present. **Covered.**\n\n#### 6. Definition of block `Transmission`.\n- **Covered**: `part def Transmission` exists.\n\n#### 7. Definition of block `DriveInterface`.\n- **Covered**: There is `DrivePwrPort`, `ClutchPort`, and `EngineToTransmissionInterface` which together model the drive interface. **Covered.**\n\n#### 8. Definition of requirement `MassLimit` with text.\n- **Covered**: `MassLimitationRequirement` and its instances (e.g., `vehicleMass1`) exist, with constraints on mass.\n\n#### 9.

Definition of requirement `PowerDelivery` with text.\n- **Covered**: There are requirements `drivePowerInterface` and `torqueGeneration`, and the interface between engine and transmission is modeled.\n\n#### 11. Definition of requirement `Reliability` with text.\n- **Covered**: `ReliabilityRequirement` and `vehicleReliability2` exist.\n\n#### 12. Allocation of `MassLimit` to `Vehicle.Mass`.\n- **Covered**: `vehicleMass1` and `vehicleMass2` requirements are associated with `Vehicle` and its `mass` attribute.\n\n#### 13. Allocation of `FuelRequirement` to `Vehicle.FuelStatus`.\n- **Covered**: The fuel constraints in `vehicleMass1` and `vehicleMass2` are associated with `Vehicle` and its fuel attributes.\n\n#### 14. Allocation of `PowerDelivery` to `Engine`, `Transmission`, and `DriveInterface`.\n- **Covered**: The requirements `drivePowerInterface` and `torqueGeneration` are associated with `Engine`, `Transmission`, and the interface.\n\n#### 15.

The main analysis is called `DynamicsAnalysis` and the main action is `StraightLineDynamics`. The package is called `VehicleLongitudinalDynamicsSimulation`.\n- **Coverage:** Equivalent system exists, but not a block with the same name. **Covered** (semantics match).\n\n#### Claim 2: The block has a property `mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `Vehicle` part has `mass :> ISQ::mass`. Used in analysis.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (type is more specific, but matches intent).\n\n#### Claim 3: The block has a property `initialPosition` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `DynamicsAnalysis` has `in attribute initialPosition :> ISQ::length`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n#### Claim 4: The block has a property `initialVelocity` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `DynamicsAnalysis` has `in attribute initialSpeed :> ISQ::speed`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (naming difference, but semantics match).\n\n#### Claim 5: The block has a property `powerOutput` of type `PowerOutputSequence`.\n- **Generated model:** `DynamicsAnalysis` has `in attribute powerProfile :> ISQ::power[*]`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (naming/type difference, but matches intent).\n\n#### Claim 6: The block has a property `timeStep` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model:** `DynamicsAnalysis` has `in attribute deltaT :> ISQ::time`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (naming difference, but semantics match).\n\n#### Claim 7: Requirement: \"This system is designed to simulate and analyze the longitudinal (straight-line) dynamic characteristics of vehicle motion.\"\n- **Generated model:** The overall structure, especially `StraightLineDynamics` and the package name, matches this requirement.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n#### Claim 8: Requirement: \"Users can input vehicle mass parameters, initial position, initial velocity, and a set of segmented power output data.\"\n- **Generated model:** All these are inputs to `DynamicsAnalysis`.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n#### Claim 9: Requirement: \"Based on the input power and operating conditions, the system will successively calculate the vehicle’s acceleration, velocity, and position at each moment using dynamic equations with a specified time step.\"\n- **Generated model:** The for-loop in `DynamicsAnalysis` successively calculates acceleration, velocity, and position using the input power, mass, initial position, initial speed, and time step.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered**.\n\n#### Claim 10: Requirement: \"It will then output the sequences of acceleration, velocity variation, and displacement throughout the vehicle's entire motion process.\"\n- **Generated model:** `accelerationProfile` is output; position and speed are updated, but only accelerationProfile is explicitly output. However, the calculation of position and speed is present and could be output similarly.\n- **Coverage:** **Partially covered** (acceleration sequence is output, position and velocity are calculated but not output as sequences). For recall, if the element is present, we count as covered.\n\n#### Claim 11: Requirement: \"This provides data support and a decision-making basis for applications such as vehicle performance analysis, control strategy development, and driving behavior evaluation.\"\n- **Generated model:** No explicit mention of these applications, but the model provides the necessary data for such analyses.\n- **Coverage:** **Covered** (implicit in the model's purpose).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

There is a block named `CruiseControlSystem`.\n\n**Properties:**\n2. `CruiseControlSystem` has a property `SpeedSetting` of type `Real`.\n3. `CruiseControlSystem` has a property `VehicleSpeed` of type `Real`.\n\n**Ports:**\n4. `CruiseControlSystem` has a port `DriverInput` of type `Command`.\n5. `CruiseControlSystem` has a port `EngineOutput` of type `ThrottleControl`.\n\n**Behavior:**\n6. `CruiseControlSystem` has a behavior named `CruiseControl`.\n\n**Activity:**\n7. `CruiseControl` behavior has an activity named `Start`.\n\n**Actions in Activity:**\n8. `Start` activity has an action `ReceiveSpeedSetting` with input `DriverInput`.\n9. `Start` activity has an action `CalculateThrottle` with inputs `SpeedSetting` and `VehicleSpeed`, and output `ThrottleControl`.\n10. `Start` activity has an action `SendThrottleCommand` with output `EngineOutput`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine coverage in the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a block named `CruiseControlSystem`.\n- **Generated model**: The package is named `'CruiseControlSystemRealization'`, and the main system is represented by the composition of parts (Driver, Vehicle, etc.). The overall system is present, though the name is slightly different.\n- **Covered**: Yes\n\n#### 2. Property `SpeedSetting` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model**: There is an `item def SetSpeed`, which seems to correspond to a speed setting, but there is no explicit property of type `Real`. The type `Real` is not mentioned, nor is a property.\n- **Covered**: No\n\n#### 3. Property `VehicleSpeed` of type `Real`.\n- **Generated model**: There is an `item def SensedSpeed`, which seems to correspond to vehicle speed, but again, no explicit property of type `Real`.\n- **Covered**: No\n\n#### 4. Port `DriverInput` of type `Command`.\n- **Generated model**: There is a `Driver` part, and messages of type `SetSpeed` are sent from the driver, but there is no explicit port of type `Command`.\n- **Covered**: No\n\n#### 5. Port `EngineOutput` of type `ThrottleControl`.\n- **Generated model**: There is an `Engine` part, and messages of type `FuelCommand` are sent to the engine, but there is no explicit port of type `ThrottleControl`.\n- **Covered**: No\n\n#### 6. Behavior `CruiseControl`.\n- **Generated model**: The `CruiseController` part and its actions (controllerBehavior) correspond to the cruise control behavior.\n- **Covered**: Yes\n\n#### 7. Activity `Start` in `CruiseControl`.\n- **Generated model**: The sequence of actions in `controllerBehavior` (receiveSetSpeed, receiveSensedSpeed, sendFuelCommand) corresponds to the activity, though the name `Start` is not used.\n- **Covered**: Yes\n\n#### 8. Action `ReceiveSpeedSetting` with input `DriverInput`.\n- **Generated model**: `controllerBehavior.receiveSetSpeed accept SetSpeed via vehicle_a` corresponds to receiving a speed setting, but the input is a message (`SetSpeed`) from the driver, not a port named `DriverInput`.\n- **Covered**: Partially. The action is present, but the port is not explicitly modeled. For recall, we consider the action as covered if the function is present.\n- **Covered**: Yes\n\n#### 9. Action `CalculateThrottle` with inputs `SpeedSetting` and `VehicleSpeed`, and output `ThrottleControl`.\n- **Generated model**: There is no explicit calculation action. The controller receives `SetSpeed` and `SensedSpeed`, then sends `FuelCommand`, but there is no explicit action named `CalculateThrottle` or an equivalent calculation step.\n- **Covered**: No\n\n#### 10. Action `SendThrottleCommand` with output `EngineOutput`.\n- **Generated model**: `controllerBehavior.sendFuelCommand send FuelCommand() to engine_a` corresponds to sending a throttle command to the engine.\n- **Covered**: Yes\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\n**Covered claims:**\n1. Block present (system as a whole)\n2. Behavior present (CruiseControl)\n3. Activity present (Start)\n4. Action: ReceiveSpeedSetting (functionally present)\n5. Action: SendThrottleCommand (functionally present)\n\n**Not covered:**\n- Property SpeedSetting (type Real)\n- Property VehicleSpeed (type Real)\n- Port DriverInput (type Command)\n- Port EngineOutput (type ThrottleControl)\n- Action: CalculateThrottle (no explicit calculation action)\n\n**Score: 5/10**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nScore: 5/10"

Vehicle has a property: TotalMass, with value 2000 kg, under condition FuelTank = Full.\n- **Covered.** The generated model defines `fullVehicleMassLimit` requirement, which sets `massReqd = 2000[kg]` and assumes `vehicle.fuelMass == vehicle.fuelFullMass`, which is equivalent.\n\n#### 3. Vehicle has a property: TotalMass, with value 1500 kg, under condition FuelTank = Empty.\n- **Covered.** The generated model defines `emptyVehicleMassLimit` requirement, which sets `massReqd = 1500[kg]` and assumes `vehicle.fuelMass == 0[kg]`, which is equivalent.\n\n#### 4.

This is a structural modeling element, so **covered**.\n- Claim 9: \"Environmental Conditions\" as a property is not present, but \"Environment\" as a part/actor is present. This is a structural modeling element, so **covered**.\n- Claim 15: \"Fueling\" requirement is modeled as a use case for \"add fuel\" and a \"Fuel Station\" part. The requirement is not present, but the functionality is. **Covered**.\n- Claim 16: \"Journey Completion\" is modeled as a use case for \"exit vehicle\". **Covered**.\n\nClaims 5 and 7: \"Starting Point\" and \"Destination\" are only mentioned in documentation, not as modeling elements. **Not covered**.\n\nClaim 13: \"Safety\" requirement is not present, only implied. **Not covered**.\n\nSo, the covered claims are: 2, 4, 9, 15, 16 = **5 claims**.\n\n**Total number of claims:** 16\n\n---\n\n**Score: 5/16**"

Definition of Block: Vehicle  \n**Covered:** Yes. `part def Vehicle` exists.\n\n#### 2. Vehicle has Property: mass  \n**Covered:** Yes. `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass` in Vehicle.\n\n#### 3. Property mass has Type: Real  \n**Covered:** Partially. The generated model uses `ISQ::mass`, which is a quantity type, not strictly \"Real\", but is semantically equivalent for modeling mass. **Accept as covered.**\n\n#### 4. Property mass has Value: 1750 kg  \n**Covered:** Yes. In `vehicle1: Vehicle`, `attribute mass redefines Vehicle::mass = 1750 [kg]`.\n\n#### 5. Definition of Block: AxleAssembly  \n**Covered:** Yes. `part def AxleAssembly`.\n\n#### 6. AxleAssembly has Property: axleType  \n**Covered:** **No.** There is no `axleType` property in AxleAssembly in the generated model.\n\n#### 7. Property axleType has Type: String  \n**Covered:** **No.** (See above.)\n\n#### 8. Definition of Block: FrontAxle  \n**Covered:** Yes. `part def FrontAxle :> Axle` (FrontAxle is defined as a specialization of Axle.)\n\n#### 9. FrontAxle has Property: steeringAngle  \n**Covered:** Yes. `attribute steeringAngle: ScalarValues::Real;` in FrontAxle.\n\n#### 10. Property steeringAngle has Type: Angle  \n**Covered:** **Partially.** The generated model uses `ScalarValues::Real` for steeringAngle, not a specific \"Angle\" type. However, in many modeling contexts, steering angle is a real-valued property, but the type is not strictly \"Angle\". **Mark as not covered** (since the type is not equivalent).\n\n#### 11. Definition of Block: RearAxle  \n**Covered:** There is no explicit `part def RearAxle`, but there is `part rearAxle: Axle;` in the usages. However, RearAxle as a type is not defined. **Not covered.**\n\n#### 12. Definition of Block: Wheel  \n**Covered:** Yes. `part def Wheel;`\n\n---\n\n#### 13.

Vehicle contains FrontAxle  \n**Covered:** Yes. In `vehicle1_c1: Vehicle`, `frontAxleAssembly` contains `frontAxle: FrontAxle`.\n\n#### 15. Vehicle contains RearAxle  \n**Covered:** Yes. In `vehicle1: Vehicle`, `rearAxleAssembly` contains `rearAxle: Axle`. There is no explicit RearAxle type, but the structure is present.\n\n#### 16. AxleAssembly contains Wheel  \n**Covered:** Yes. In both `frontAxleAssembly` and `rearAxleAssembly`, there are parts `frontWheel: Wheel[2]` and `rearWheel: Wheel[2]`.\n\n#### 17.
