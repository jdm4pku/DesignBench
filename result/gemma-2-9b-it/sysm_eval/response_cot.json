Part and Type Definitions\n\n1. **A1**: Not present in reference model. **Not supported**\n2. **B11 with port pe**: B11 exists, but in the reference, pe is an Interface, not a port. **Partially supported** (B11 exists, but pe is not a port)\n3. **B12 with port pf**: B12 exists, but no port pf in reference. **Not supported**\n4. **B21 with port pg**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n5. **B22 with port ph**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n6. **C1 with ports pa, pb**: C1 exists with pb, but not pa. **Partially supported** (C1 and pb supported, pa not)\n7. **C2 with port pc**: Supported.\n8. **C3 with port pd**: Supported.\n9. **C4**: Supported (as a block, no ports in reference).\n\n#### B. System Structure (Instances and Containment)\n\n10. **a11: A1**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n11. **a11 contains b11: B11**: Supported (b11 is a top-level block in reference, but containment is not explicit).\n12. **b11 contains c1: C1**: Supported.\n13. **b11 contains c2: C2**: Supported.\n14. **b11 connects c1.pa to c2.pc**: No pa port in reference, and no such connector. **Not supported**\n15. **b11 binds port pe to c1.pb**: In reference, pe is an interface with port p, and there is a connector from c1.pb to pe.p. This is a binding, so **Supported** (semantically equivalent).\n16. **a11 contains b12: B12**: Supported (b12 is a top-level block in reference, but containment is not explicit).\n17. **b12 contains c3: C3**: Supported.\n18. **b12 contains c4: C4**: Supported.\n19. **b12 binds port pf to c3.pd**: No pf port in reference, so **Not supported**\n20. **a11 connects b11.pe to b12.pf**: No pf in reference, so **Not supported**\n\n21. **a12: A1**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n22. **a12 contains b21: B21**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n23. **b21 references c1: C1 = a11.b11.c1**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n24. **b21 references c3: C3 = a11.b12.c3**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n25. **b21 connects c1.pb to c3.pd**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n26. **b21 binds port pg to c1.pa**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n27. **a12 contains b22: B22**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n28. **b22 references c2: C2 = a11.b11.c2**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n29. **b22 references c4: C4 = a11.b12.c4**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n30. **b22 binds port ph to c2.pc**: Not present in reference. **Not supported**\n\n---\n\n#### Supported Claims\n\nLet's enumerate the supported claims:\n\n- 2. B11 (block) exists, but pe is an interface, not a port. Let's count this as **partially supported** (but for scoring, only count fully supported).\n- 6. C1 with pb: only pb is supported, not pa. So, only the pb port is supported.\n- 7. C2 with pc: **Supported**\n- 8. C3 with pd: **Supported**\n- 9. C4: **Supported**\n- 12. b11 contains c1: **Supported**\n- 13. b11 contains c2: **Supported**\n- 15. b11 binds port pe to c1.pb: **Supported** (semantically equivalent to connector from c1.pb to pe.p)\n- 16. a11 contains b12: **Supported**\n- 17. b12 contains c3: **Supported**\n- 18. b12 contains c4: **Supported**\n\nSo, let's count the number of fully supported claims:\n\n1.

(Not supported)\n   - 9c. **Conditional if monitor.charge < 100, then action 'addCharge'**: The reference model's loop condition is 'BatteryLevel < 100', and inside the loop, it calls 'ReplenishBattery()'. The conditional is implicit in the loop. (Supported, as the structure is equivalent)\n   - 9d. **Loop continues until charging.monitor.charge >= 100**: Equivalent to the reference model's loop condition. (Supported)\n   - 9e. **After the loop, action 'endCharging'**: The reference model has an 'exit' block that sets 'BatteryLevel = 100', but no explicit 'endCharging' action. (Not supported)\n   - 9f. **'done' (end of action sequence)**: This is just a terminator, not a modeling claim.

However, in the reference model, `Ready` is a property of `SensorStatus`, which is a property of `Sensor`. In the generated model, `ready` is a direct property of `Sensor`. So, the property is present, but the structure is flattened.\n\n5. **Action: If SensorStatus.Ready then UpdatedSensor = UpdateSensorOperation(Sensor)**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model's action (in Alf comments) checks `if (sensor.ready) { Update(sensor); }`, which is similar in logic, but does not mention `UpdatedSensor` or `UpdateSensorOperation`. The update operation is implied, but not explicitly modeled.\n\n6. **Block: Sensor**  \n   - **Covered.** There is a `Sensor` block in the generated model.\n\n   - 6a. **Property: Status : SensorStatus**  \n     - **Not covered.** The generated model's `Sensor` does not have a `Status` property of type `SensorStatus`; instead, it has a direct `ready : Boolean` property.\n\n7. **Block: SensorUpdateOperation**  \n   - **Not covered.** No such block in the generated model.\n\n   - 7a. **Input: Sensor : Sensor**  \n     - **Not covered.** No such input in the generated model.\n\n   - 7b. **Output: UpdatedSensor : Sensor**  \n     - **Not covered.** No such output in the generated model.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- 1. Block: SensorManagementSystem — **Not covered**\n- 2. Property: SensorCount : Integer = 0 — **Not covered**\n- 3. Activity: UpdateSensor — **Partially covered** (but not as an activity, and not named the same)\n  - 3a. Input: Sensor : Sensor — **Partially covered** (input is a collection, not a single sensor)\n  - 3b. Output: UpdatedSensor : Sensor — **Not covered**\n- 4. Block: SensorStatus (inside UpdateSensor) — **Not covered**\n  - 4a. State/Property: Ready : Boolean — **Partially covered** (flattened into Sensor)\n- 5. Action: If SensorStatus.Ready then UpdatedSensor = UpdateSensorOperation(Sensor) — **Partially covered** (logic present, but not structure)\n- 6. Block: Sensor — **Covered**\n  - 6a. Property: Status : SensorStatus — **Not covered**\n- 7. Block: SensorUpdateOperation — **Not covered**\n  - 7a. Input: Sensor : Sensor — **Not covered**\n  - 7b. Output: UpdatedSensor : Sensor — **Not covered**\n\nLet's be strict: only count as \"covered\" if the claim is present in the generated model, even if the structure is flattened, as long as the semantics are preserved.\n\n- 4a. The property `Ready : Boolean` is present, though not as a property of `SensorStatus`, but as a property of `Sensor`. Let's count this as covered.\n- 5. The action logic is present, though not as a formal action, but as a comment in Alf. Let's count this as covered.\n- 6. Block: Sensor — covered.\n\nSo, the covered claims are:\n- 4a. State/Property: Ready : Boolean\n- 5. Action: If SensorStatus.Ready then UpdatedSensor = UpdateSensorOperation(Sensor)\n- 6. Block: Sensor\n\n**Score: 3/10**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nScore: 3/10"

Declaration of property `off` of type Boolean, default value `false`.\n- **Generated model**: In `state vehicleStates`, there is a state `off` and an `entry; then off;` statement, but no explicit Boolean property named `off`. The state machine uses `off` as a state, not as a Boolean property.\n  **Not covered**\n\n#### 3. Declaration of property `started` of type Boolean, default value `false`.\n- **Generated model**: There is a state `on` and `starting`, but no explicit Boolean property `started`.

Definition of behavior `StartUp` with:\n   - Trigger: `vehicleStartSignal`\n   - Effect: `off = false`\n   - Effect: `started = true`\n- **Generated model**: In `state off`, `accept VehicleStartSignal then starting;` and in `state starting`, `accept VehicleOnSignal ... then on;`. The transition from `off` to `starting` is triggered by `VehicleStartSignal`, which is equivalent to `vehicleStartSignal`.

Definition of behavior `Shutdown` with:\n   - Trigger: `shutdownSignal`\n   - Effect: `off = true`\n   - Effect: `started = false`\n   - Effect: `parkingBrakeApplied = true`\n- **Generated model**: There is a `VehicleOffSignal` that transitions to `off` state.

The effects on properties are not explicit, but the state transition and action are present.\n  **Partially covered**: The trigger and parking brake effect are covered, but not the explicit property assignments.\n\n#### 6. Definition of constraint `StartCondition`:\n   - `started = (brakePedalDepressed and vehicleOnSignal)`\n- **Generated model**: In `state starting`, `accept VehicleOnSignal if operatingVehicle.brakePedalDepressed ... then on;` This models the same logic: the transition to \"on\" (i.e., started) only occurs if `brakePedalDepressed` and `VehicleOnSignal` are true.\n  **Covered**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

There is a class named `Vehicle`.\n3. `Vehicle` has an attribute `VIN` of type `String`.\n4. `Vehicle` has an attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n5. `Vehicle` has a part `components` which is a collection (`*`) of `composition::Vehicle::Component` (i.e., a containment relation to `Component`).\n\n**Component**\n6. There is a class named `Component`.\n7. `Component` has an attribute `serialNumber` of type `String`.\n8. `Component` has an attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n9. `Component` has a part `subcomponents` which is a collection (`*`) of `composition::Component::Component` (i.e., a containment relation to `Component`).\n\n**MassFilter**\n10. There is a class named `MassFilter`.\n11. `MassFilter` has an attribute `threshold` of type `Real`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. Package named `VehicleMassManagement`\n- **Not covered**: The generated model uses a different package name (`VehicleMassAggregation`). (But per instructions, naming differences can be ignored if structure/semantics match.) So, **covered**.\n\n#### 2. Class `Vehicle`\n- **Covered**: The generated model has a `car` part, which is a specialization of `CarPart` and `compositeThing`, which together represent a vehicle.\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has attribute `VIN: String`\n- **Covered**: In the generated model, `car` has an attribute `vin` which is mapped to `serialNumber` (via `attribute vin :>> serialNumber;`). So, the VIN is present, though mapped to serialNumber. **Covered**.\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle` has attribute `mass: Real`\n- **Covered**: The generated model has `simpleMass` and `totalMass` attributes for `MassedThing` (which is the base for all massed things, including `car`). The type is `ISQ::mass`, which is a real-valued mass. **Covered**.\n\n#### 5. `Vehicle` has part `components: Component[*]`\n- **Covered**: The generated model has `carParts: CarPart[*] :>> subcomponents;` in `car`, which is a collection of `CarPart` (which is a kind of `MassedThing`), corresponding to `components`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 6. Class `Component`\n- **Covered**: The generated model has `CarPart` and `MassedThing`, which together represent components.\n\n#### 7. `Component` has attribute `serialNumber: String`\n- **Covered**: `CarPart` has `serialNumber: String`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 8. `Component` has attribute `mass: Real`\n- **Covered**: `MassedThing` has `simpleMass: ISQ::mass`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 9. `Component` has part `subcomponents: Component[*]`\n- **Covered**: `compositeThing` has `subcomponents: MassedThing[*]`, and `CarPart` can be used as a subcomponent. **Covered**.\n\n#### 10. Class `MassFilter`\n- **Covered**: The generated model has `filteredMassThing`, which is a specialization of `compositeThing` and has an attribute `minMass: ISQ::mass`, which is used to filter subcomponents by mass. This is equivalent to a mass filter. **Covered**.\n\n#### 11. `MassFilter` has attribute `threshold: Real`\n- **Covered**: `filteredMassThing` has `minMass: ISQ::mass`, which is equivalent to `threshold`. **Covered**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

An attribute chassisMass of type MassValue.\n   - 6c. A part named engine of type Engine, which contains:\n     - 6c.i. An attribute mass of type MassValue.\n   - 6d. A part named transmission of type Engine (likely a typo, should be Transmission), which contains:\n     - 6d.i. An attribute mass of type MassValue.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model\n\n#### 1. The model is a package named 'VehicleMassComplianceSystem'.\n- **Not supported** (Reference model is a block named VehicleMassManagementSystem; naming difference is ignored, but package vs block is a structural difference.)\n\n#### 3. Part definition for Engine.\n- **Supported** (Reference model defines block Engine.)\n\n#### 4. Part definition for Transmission.\n- **Supported** (Reference model defines block Transmission.)\n\n#### 5. Constraint definition named MassConstraint, with:\n- 5a. Input parameter partMasses : MassValue[0..*].\n  - **Supported** (Reference model's constraint sums the masses of Chassis, Engine, Transmission; equivalent to a list of masses.)\n- 5b. Input parameter massLimit : MassValue.\n  - **Supported** (Reference model uses TotalMass as the limit.)\n- 5c. Constraint: sum(partMasses) <= massLimit.\n  - **Supported** (Reference model: Chassis.Mass + Engine.Mass + Transmission.Mass <= TotalMass.)\n\n#### 6. Part definition for Vehicle, which contains:\n- 6a. Constraint massConstraint : MassConstraint, with:\n  - 6a.i. in partMasses = (chassisMass, engine.mass, transmission.mass)\n    - **Supported** (Reference model: Chassis.Mass, Engine.Mass, Transmission.Mass.)\n  - 6a.ii. in massLimit = 2500[kg]\n    - **Supported** (Reference model: TotalMass = 2500.0.)\n- 6b. Attribute chassisMass : MassValue.\n  - **Supported** (Reference model: Chassis has property Mass : Real.)\n- 6c. Part engine : Engine, which contains:\n  - 6c.i. Attribute mass : MassValue.\n    - **Supported** (Reference model: Engine has property Mass : Real.)\n- 6d. Part transmission : Engine, which contains:\n  - 6d.i. Attribute mass : MassValue.\n    - **Partially supported**: Reference model has block Transmission with property Mass : Real, but in the generated model, transmission is of type Engine, not Transmission. This is a modeling error, but the attribute mass is present in both.\n\n#### Summary of claims:\nLet's enumerate the claims for clarity:\n\n| #   | Claim                                                                 | Supported? |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| 1   | Model is a package                                                    | No         |\n| 3   | Part definition for Engine                                            | Yes        |\n| 4   | Part definition for Transmission                                      | Yes        |\n| 5a  | MassConstraint: input partMasses                                      | Yes        |\n| 5b  | MassConstraint: input massLimit                                       | Yes        |\n| 5c  | MassConstraint: sum(partMasses) <= massLimit                          | Yes        |\n| 6a  | Vehicle: constraint massConstraint                                    | Yes        |\n| 6a.i| massConstraint: in partMasses = (chassisMass, engine.mass, transmission.mass) | Yes        |\n| 6a.ii| massConstraint: in massLimit = 2500[kg]                              | Yes        |\n| 6b  | Vehicle: attribute chassisMass                                        | Yes        |\n| 6c  | Vehicle: part engine : Engine                                         | Yes        |\n| 6c.i| engine: attribute mass                                                | Yes        |\n| 6d  | Vehicle: part transmission : Engine                                   | No         |\n| 6d.i| transmission: attribute mass                                          | Yes        |\n\n**Total atomic claims:** 14  \n**Supported claims:** 12\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The descriptions are not verbatim, but the constraints and structure match the intent. **Covered.**\n\n---\n\n**3.

There is no direct attribute named `TotalMass`, but the concept is present via the requirement and attribute redefinition.\n  - **Accept as covered** (since the semantics are present).\n- **1.3 TotalMass has a value of 2000 kg.**\n  - **Covered.** The requirement `fullVehicleMassLimit` sets `massReqd = 2000[kg]`, and `massActual` is defined as `vehicle.dryMass + vehicle.fuelMass`, which is the total mass.\n- **1.4 Vehicle has a mass property named EmptyMass.**\n  - **Partially covered.** There is no direct attribute named `EmptyMass`, but the requirement `emptyVehicleMassLimit` sets `massReqd = 1500[kg]` and constrains `fuelMass == 0`, so `dryMass` is equivalent to `EmptyMass`.\n  - **Accept as covered** (semantics present).\n- **1.5 EmptyMass has a value of 1500 kg.**\n  - **Covered.** See above; `emptyVehicleMassLimit` sets this.\n\n#### 2.

There is a variant `SixCylinderEngine` where `CylinderCount = 6`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1. There is a block (type) named `Engine`.\n- **Generated model:** Yes, there is a part def `Engine`.\n\n#### 2. `Engine` has a property `CylinderCount` of type `Integer`, with possible values 4 or 6.\n- **Generated model:** Not explicitly present as a property. Instead, the number of cylinders is modeled by the multiplicity of the `cylinder` part (e.g., `[4]` or `[6]`), but there is no explicit `CylinderCount` property.\n\n#### 3. `Engine` has a property `CylinderDiameter` of type `Real`, with possible values 70 or 100.\n- **Generated model:** There is a variation attribute `DiameterChoices` with variants `diameterSmall = 70[mm]` and `diameterLarge = 100[mm]`, which is equivalent to the possible values for `CylinderDiameter`. However, there is no explicit `CylinderDiameter` property on `Engine`.\n\n#### 4. `Engine` has a part named `Cylinder`.\n- **Generated model:** Yes, `Engine` has a part `cylinder : Cylinder[2..*]`.\n\n#### 5. The `Cylinder` part has a property `Diameter` of type `Real`, set to the value of `CylinderDiameter`.\n- **Generated model:** `Cylinder` has an attribute `diameter : Diameter[1]`. The connection to `CylinderDiameter` is indirect via the variation attribute, but the structure is present.\n\n#### 6. There is a constraint: `CylinderCount >= 1`.\n- **Generated model:** Not explicitly present.\n\n#### 7. There is a constraint: `CylinderDiameter >= 0`.\n- **Generated model:** Not explicitly present.\n\n#### 8. There is a variant `FourCylinderEngine` where `CylinderCount = 4`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part `'4cylEngine' : Engine` with `part redefines cylinder[4]`, and a variant `'4cylEngine'` in `EngineChoices`. This is equivalent.\n\n#### 9. There is a variant `SixCylinderEngine` where `CylinderCount = 6`.\n- **Generated model:** There is a part `'6cylEngine' : Engine` with `part redefines cylinder[6]`, and a variant `'6cylEngine'` in `EngineChoices`. This is equivalent.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n| # | Claim | Covered? | Notes |\n|---|-------|----------|-------|\n| 1 | Engine block/type | Yes | Present as part def |\n| 2 | CylinderCount property | **No** | Not explicit, only as part multiplicity |\n| 3 | CylinderDiameter property | **Partial/No** | Values present, but not as property on Engine |\n| 4 | Cylinder part | Yes | Present |\n| 5 | Cylinder.Diameter property | Yes | Present, connection to variation attribute |\n| 6 | Constraint: CylinderCount >= 1 | No | Not present |\n| 7 | Constraint: CylinderDiameter >= 0 | No | Not present |\n| 8 | FourCylinderEngine variant | Yes | Present as variant/part |\n| 9 | SixCylinderEngine variant | Yes | Present as variant/part |\n\n**Covered claims:** 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 (5 claims)\n\n**Total claims:** 9\n\n---\n\n**Score: 5/9**"

The concept is present, but not the structure.)\n\n#### System structure (parts)\n16. **Supported** (Reference model has a top-level 'System' block, which contains a 'RootComponent', which contains subsystems and components. 'vehicle' is analogous to 'System' or 'RootComponent'.)\n17. **Supported** (Reference model has 'RootComponent' containing 'SubSystem1', which contains 'Component1' and 'Component2'. 'interior' is analogous to a subsystem.)\n18. **Not supported** (No 'alarm' in reference model)\n19. **Partially supported** (Reference model has 'Component1' with 'safety_attribute \"Mandatory\"', which is analogous to 'seatBelt' with @Safety{isMandatory = true}, but not a direct match in naming or structure.)\n20. **Not supported** (No 'frontSeat' in reference)\n21. **Partially supported** (Reference model has 'Component2' with 'safety_attribute \"Optional\"', which is analogous to 'driverAirBag' with @Safety{isMandatory = false}, but not a direct match.)\n22. **Supported** (Reference model has 'SubSystem2', analogous to 'bodyAssy')\n23. **Not supported** (No 'body' in reference)\n24. **Not supported** (No 'bumper' in reference)\n25. **Not supported** (No 'keylessEntry' in reference)\n26. **Not supported** (No 'wheelAssy' in reference)\n27. **Not supported** (No 'wheel' in reference)\n28. **Not supported** (No 'antilockBrakes' in reference)\n\n#### Packages for safety features\n29. **Not supported** (No such package in reference)\n30. **Not supported**\n31. **Not supported**\n32. **Not supported**\n\n#### Views and rendering\n33. **Not supported** (No views in reference)\n34. **Not supported**\n35. **Not supported**\n36. **Not supported**\n37. **Not supported**\n38. **Not supported**\n39. **Not supported**\n40. **Not supported**\n41. **Not supported**\n42. **Not supported**\n43. **Not supported**\n44. **Not supported**\n45. **Not supported**\n46. **Not supported**\n\n---\n\n#### Supported/Partially Supported Claims\n\nLet's clarify the partial matches:\n\n- Claim 15: The reference model uses a property 'safety_attribute' with values \"Mandatory\" or \"Optional\" on components, which is conceptually similar to the generated model's @Safety{isMandatory = true/false}, but the structure is different (property vs. metadata stereotype with Boolean). For this evaluation, since the atomic claim is about the existence of a metadata type with a Boolean attribute, and the reference only has a string property, **this is not fully supported**.\n\n- Claims 19 and 21: The reference model has components with safety attributes, but the names and structure do not match (e.g., 'seatBelt' vs. 'Component1'). Since the atomic claim is about the existence of a part named 'seatBelt' with a specific safety attribute, and the reference model does not have a 'seatBelt' part, **these are not supported**.\n\n- Claims 16, 17, and 22: The reference model has a hierarchical structure of system, root component, subsystems, and components. The generated model has 'vehicle' with 'interior', 'bodyAssy', etc. While the names differ, the structure is similar. If we ignore naming differences as instructed, these can be considered **supported**.\n\n**Therefore, the only supported claims are:**\n- 16. Definition of part 'vehicle' (as top-level system)\n- 17. 'vehicle' contains part 'interior' (as a subsystem)\n- 22. 'vehicle' contains part 'bodyAssy' (as a subsystem)\n\n---\n\n### 3.
