The `Vehicle` block has a property `mass` of type `Quantity` with value `1750 kg`.**  \n- **Covered:** Partially.  \n  - The `Vehicle` block has an attribute `mass` (type is `ISQ::mass`, which is a quantity type, so this is equivalent).\n  - The value `1750 kg` is set in the instance `vehicle1: Vehicle` as a default value for `mass`.\n  - **Conclusion:** Covered.\n\n**3. The `Vehicle` block has a property `frontAxle` which is a reference to a `FrontAxle` block.**  \n- **Covered:** Partially.  \n  - In the generated model, `vehicle1` has a part `frontAxleAssembly` (of type `AxleAssembly`), which contains a part `frontAxle: Axle`.\n  - In the variant `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxle_c1: FrontAxle` redefines `frontAxle`.\n  - There is no direct property `frontAxle` in `Vehicle`, but the structure is present via the assembly.\n  - **Conclusion:** The reference is present, but only via an intermediate assembly. The semantic intent (Vehicle has a front axle) is preserved, though the structure is more elaborate. **Covered.**\n\n**4. The `Vehicle` block has a property `rearAxle` which is a reference to a `RearAxle` block.**  \n- **Covered:** Same as above. `rearAxleAssembly` contains `rearAxle: Axle`, and in the variant, `rearAxle_c1` redefines it. **Covered.**\n\n**5. There is a block named `FrontAxle`.**  \n- **Covered:** Yes. `part def FrontAxle :> Axle` exists.\n\n**6. The `FrontAxle` block has a property `tires` which is a list (cardinality 1..1) of `Tire` blocks.**  \n- **Covered:**  \n  - In the generated model, `FrontAxle` does not have a `tires` property.\n  - Instead, in the instance, `frontAxleAssembly` contains `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered;`.\n  - The type `Wheel` is likely equivalent to `Tire`.\n  - However, the property is not on `FrontAxle`, but on the assembly.\n  - **Conclusion:** Not directly covered. The structure is different: the tires/wheels are not properties of the axle blocks, but of the assembly. **Not covered.**\n\n**7. There is a block named `RearAxle`.**  \n- **Covered:** Yes. `part def RearAxle :> Axle` is not explicitly present, but `part def Axle` and the use of `rearAxle: Axle` and `rearAxle_c1` in the variant covers the existence of a rear axle block. However, there is no explicit `RearAxle` part definition.  \n- **Conclusion:** **Not covered.**\n\n**8. The `RearAxle` block has a property `tires` which is a list (cardinality 1..1) of `Tire` blocks.**  \n- **Covered:** Same as for `FrontAxle`. The property is not on `RearAxle`, but on the assembly. **Not covered.**\n\n**9. There is a block named `Tire`.**  \n- **Covered:** There is a `part def Wheel;` in the generated model, which is likely intended to be equivalent to `Tire`.  \n- **Conclusion:** **Covered.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's list the claims and their coverage:\n\n| # | Claim                                                                 | Covered? |\n|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1 | There is a block named `Vehicle`.                                     | Yes      |\n| 2 | The `Vehicle` block has a property `mass` of type `Quantity` with value `1750 kg`. | Yes      |\n| 3 | The `Vehicle` block has a property `frontAxle` which is a reference to a `FrontAxle` block. | Yes      |\n| 4 | The `Vehicle` block has a property `rearAxle` which is a reference to a `RearAxle` block. | Yes      |\n| 5 | There is a block named `FrontAxle`.                                   | Yes      |\n| 6 | The `FrontAxle` block has a property `tires` which is a list (cardinality 1..1) of `Tire` blocks. | No       |\n| 7 | There is a block named `RearAxle`.                                    | No       |\n| 8 | The `RearAxle` block has a property `tires` which is a list (cardinality 1..1) of `Tire` blocks. | No       |\n| 9 | There is a block named `Tire`.                                        | Yes      |\n\n**Score: 6/9**"

The reference model does not define any FMEA concepts, situations, causes, effects, requirements, or metadata. **Not supported.**\n- Claims 67–93 (FMEAUserModel): These define requirements, FMEA items, events, parts, and connections for a glucose meter system, including battery, patient, pump, reservoir, and events like \"battery depleted\", \"therapy delay\", etc.\n\n  - The reference model defines a block \"BloodGlucoseMeterSystem\" with ports: UserInterface, Battery, GlucoseSensor.\n  - The generated model defines a part 'glucose meter' (claim 85), which could correspond to the system block, but the reference model does not define a part named 'glucose meter'—it is the system itself.\n  - The generated model defines a part 'battery' (claim 87), which matches the reference model's port \"Battery\".\n  - The generated model defines events 'battery depleted', 'battery cannot be charged', 'glucose level undetected', 'therapy delay', etc. The reference model does not define any events or failure modes.\n  - The generated model defines parts 'pump', 'reservoir', and 'patient', which are not present in the reference model.\n  - The generated model defines requirements, FMEA items, and connections, which are not present in the reference model.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The only possible overlap is the presence of a \"battery\" as a part/port. However, in the generated model, \"battery\" is a part of \"glucose meter\", while in the reference model, \"Battery\" is a port of the system. This is a weak correspondence, but per the instruction, we can ignore naming/formatting differences if the structure and semantics match.\n- However, the reference model does not define a part structure for \"glucose meter\" or \"battery\" as a part; it only defines ports.\n- No events, requirements, FMEA items, or connections are present in the reference model.\n\n**Therefore, none of the atomic claims in the generated model are supported by the reference model.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n**Score: 0/93**",

Part: `Driver` of type `Actor`\n- **Generated model:** `part def Driver;` and multiple usages of `driver` as a part. The type `Actor` is not explicitly stated, but the role is present.\n- **Coverage:** The `Driver` part is present, though the type is not specified as `Actor`. **Covered**\n\n#### 3. Part: `CruiseControlInterface` of type `Interface`\n- **Generated model:** There is an `interface driverToVehicleInterface` and several ports, but no explicit `CruiseControlInterface` part or block. The interface is modeled, but not with the same name.\n- **Coverage:** The concept of an interface between driver and vehicle is present, but not as a part/block named `CruiseControlInterface`. **Partially covered** (but per instructions, only count if equivalent element is present). **Not covered**\n\n#### 4. Part: `CruiseController` of type `System`\n- **Generated model:** `part def CruiseController;` and multiple usages of `cruiseController` as a part. The type `System` is not explicitly stated, but the role is present.\n- **Coverage:** The `CruiseController` part is present. **Covered**\n\n#### 5. Part: `SpeedSensor` of type `Sensor`\n- **Generated model:** There is a `part def Speedometer;` and `part speedometer : Speedometer`. The reference model uses `SpeedSensor`, the generated model uses `Speedometer`. These are functionally equivalent in the context of cruise control.\n- **Coverage:** Equivalent element present. **Covered**\n\n#### 6. Part: `Engine` of type `System`\n- **Generated model:** `part def Engine;` and multiple usages of `engine` as a part. The type `System` is not explicitly stated, but the role is present.\n- **Coverage:** The `Engine` part is present. **Covered**\n\n#### 7. Six parts: `DataPort` of type `DataPort`\n- **Generated model:** There are multiple ports defined (e.g., `setSpeedPort`, `sensedSpeedPort`, `fuelCommandPort`), but no explicit part/block named `DataPort`. The concept of data ports is modeled via port definitions, but not as parts named `DataPort`.\n- **Coverage:** The concept is present, but not as explicit parts named `DataPort`. **Not covered**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count:\n\n- **Total atomic claims:** 1 (system) + 5 (distinct parts) + 6 (DataPort parts) = **12**\n- **Covered:**\n  - System block: 1\n  - Driver: 1\n  - CruiseController: 1\n  - SpeedSensor/Speedometer: 1\n  - Engine: 1\n- **Not covered:**\n  - CruiseControlInterface: 1\n  - DataPort (6): 6\n\n**Total covered:** 1 (system) + 4 (parts) = **5**\n\n---\n\n## Final Score\n\n**Score: 5/12**"

Since the instructions say to ignore naming differences if the structure and semantics match, and both are top-level packages for a vehicle mass system, **this claim is covered**.\n\n#### Claim 2: There is a BlockDefinition named \"VehicleMassManagementSystem\".\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit \"BlockDefinition\" named \"VehicleMassManagementSystem\". However, the generated model defines several parts and structures for mass management (e.g., MassedThing, CarPart, car, etc.), which together represent a vehicle mass management system.\n- **Assessment:** The generated model does not have a single block or part named \"VehicleMassManagementSystem\", but it does model the system as a whole via its structure.

The \"VehicleSystem\" block has a feature \"Chassis\" which is a reference to another block (presumably a \"Chassis\" block).\n\n- **Generated model**: In \"Vehicle\", there is an attribute \"chassisMass : MassValue\", but there is no explicit \"Chassis\" part or reference.

This is likely equivalent to `CurbMass`. However, there is no initial value specified.\n- **Coverage**: **Partially covered** (property exists, but initial value is missing).\n\n#### Claim 3: `VehicleSystem` has a property `FuelMass` of type `Mass`, unit `kg`, initial value `0`.\n- **Generated model**: `Vehicle` has `fuelMass: MassValue`.

However, in the requirement, `massActual = vehicle.dryMass + vehicle.fuelMass`, which is equivalent to total vehicle mass.\n- **Coverage**: **Covered** (semantics are present, though not as a direct attribute).\n\n#### Claim 5: `VehicleSystem` has a property `FuelTankFull` of type `Boolean`, initial value `false`.\n- **Generated model**: There is no explicit `FuelTankFull` property.

However, \"LogicalElement\" and \"PhysicalElement\" do not exist in the reference, and \"PowerTrain\" is \"PowerUnit\" in the reference. If we accept \"PowerTrain\" as equivalent to \"PowerUnit\" (since both are the main physical power component), then claim 12 could be considered supported. However, the reference model uses \"PowerUnit\" and not \"PowerTrain\", and there is no explicit mapping.\n\nGiven the instructions to ignore naming differences if the structure and semantics match, let's reconsider:\n\n- Claim 7: **Supported.**\n- Claim 12: **Supported.** (powerTrain/PowerUnit as the main physical power component)\n- Claim 4: **Not supported.** (No LogicalElement in reference)\n- Claim 11: **Supported.** (PowerTrain/PowerUnit as the main physical power component)\n\nSo, claims 7, 11, and 12 are supported if we accept PowerTrain ≈ PowerUnit.\n\n**Final count:**\n- Supported: 3 (claims 7, 11, 12)\n- Total: 16\n\n**Score: 3/16**",

There is a Block named `VehicleStructuralArchitecture`.\n2. There is a Block named `Vehicle`.\n3. The `Vehicle` block has an attribute `mass` (likely of type mass or similar).\n4. There is a Block named `AxleAssembly`.\n5. There is a Block named `Axle`.\n6. The `Axle` block has an attribute `mass`.\n7. There is a Block named `FrontAxle` that specializes (inherits from) `Axle`.\n8. The `FrontAxle` block has an attribute `steeringAngle` (likely of type Real).\n9. There is a Block named `Wheel`.\n10. The `Vehicle` block has a part property `frontAxleAssembly` of type `AxleAssembly`.\n11. The `Vehicle` block has a part property `rearAxleAssembly` of type `AxleAssembly`.\n12. The `AxleAssembly` block has a part property `frontAxle` of type `Axle` (or `FrontAxle` for front assembly).\n13. The `AxleAssembly` block has a part property `frontWheel` of type `Wheel` with multiplicity 2, ordered.\n14. The `AxleAssembly` block has a part property `rearAxle` of type `Axle`.\n15. The `AxleAssembly` block has a part property `rearWheel` of type `Wheel` with multiplicity 2, ordered.\n\n*Note: Since the reference model is incomplete, this list is reconstructed based on standard SysML modeling practices and the content of the generated model.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n| # | Reference Claim | Covered in Generated Model? | Notes |\n|---|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------|\n| 1 | Block `VehicleStructuralArchitecture` | **Yes** | As package name and context. |\n| 2 | Block `Vehicle` | **Yes** | `part def Vehicle` |\n| 3 | `Vehicle` has attribute `mass` | **Yes** | `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass` |\n| 4 | Block `AxleAssembly` | **Yes** | `part def AxleAssembly` |\n| 5 | Block `Axle` | **Yes** | `part def Axle` |\n| 6 | `Axle` has attribute `mass` | **Yes** | `attribute mass :> ISQ::mass` |\n| 7 | Block `FrontAxle` specializes `Axle` | **Yes** | `part def FrontAxle :> Axle` |\n| 8 | `FrontAxle` has attribute `steeringAngle` | **Yes** | `attribute steeringAngle: ScalarValues::Real` |\n| 9 | Block `Wheel` | **Yes** | `part def Wheel` |\n| 10 | `Vehicle` has part `frontAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly` | **Yes** | In `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` |\n| 11 | `Vehicle` has part `rearAxleAssembly: AxleAssembly` | **Yes** | In `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` |\n| 12 | `AxleAssembly` has part `frontAxle: Axle` (or `FrontAxle`) | **Yes** | In `frontAxleAssembly` of `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` |\n| 13 | `AxleAssembly` has part `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered` | **Yes** | In `frontAxleAssembly` of `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` |\n| 14 | `AxleAssembly` has part `rearAxle: Axle` | **Yes** | In `rearAxleAssembly` of `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` |\n| 15 | `AxleAssembly` has part `rearWheel: Wheel[2] ordered` | **Yes** | In `rearAxleAssembly` of `vehicle1` and `vehicle1_c1` |\n\n---\n\n## 3.
