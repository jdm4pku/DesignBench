Instead, there are `TrailerHitch`, `HitchBall`, and `TrailerCoupler`. None is directly equivalent to `Hitch`.\n\n4. **`Vehicle` has a property/reference to `Hitch`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: In the generated model, `Vehicle` has a reference to `HitchBall`, not to `Hitch` or `TrailerHitch`. The closest is `hitchBall : HitchBall`, but this is not equivalent to a reference to a `Hitch`.\n\n5. **`Trailer` has a property/reference to `Hitch` (named `Connector`)**  \n   - **Not Covered**: In the generated model, `Trailer` has a reference to `TrailerCoupler`, not to `Hitch`. No property named `Connector` or equivalent.\n\n6. **Interaction `Connect` defined**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined in the generated model.\n\n7. **Interaction `Disconnect` defined**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined in the generated model.\n\n8. **`Connect` interaction involves `Vehicle` and `Trailer`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined.\n\n9. **`Connect` interaction sends `Event.Start`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined.\n\n10. **`Connect` interaction receives `Event.Complete`**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined.\n\n11. **`Disconnect` interaction involves `Vehicle` and `Trailer`**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined.\n\n12. **`Disconnect` interaction sends `Event.Start`**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined.\n\n13. **`Disconnect` interaction receives `Event.Complete`**  \n    - **Not Covered**: No interactions are defined.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 2/13**\n\n- Only the definitions of `Vehicle` and `Trailer` components are covered.\n- The definition of `Hitch`, the relationships, and all interactions are **not** covered."

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. System named `VehicleA`\n- **Covered**: `part def VehicleA` is defined.\n\n#### 2. Package named `VehicleA`\n- **Covered**: There is a package `Definitions` and a part `VehicleA`, but not a package named `VehicleA`. However, the top-level package is `'5-State-based Behavior-1'`, and the context is about `VehicleA`. For recall, this is **covered**.\n\n#### 3. Package named `MainControl` inside `VehicleA`\n- **Not Covered**: There is no explicit `MainControl` package. The state machines are defined under `Usages` and `Definitions`. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 4. State machine named `VehicleControlSM` inside `MainControl`\n- **Not Covered**: There is no explicit state machine named `VehicleControlSM`. There are state definitions and state machines, but not with this name. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 5. State `Off`\n- **Covered**: There is a state `off` in `'operational states'` in `vehicle states`.\n\n#### 6. State `Starting`\n- **Covered**: There is a state `starting` in `'operational states'` in `vehicle states`.\n\n#### 7. State `Running`\n- **Covered**: There is a state `on` in `'operational states'` in `vehicle states`. The `on` state corresponds to `Running` (since it is after `starting` and before health management). **Covered**.\n\n#### 8. State `HealthManagement`\n- **Covered**: There is a `'health states'` region in `vehicle states`, with states `normal`, `maintenance`, and `degraded`. The `health states` region corresponds to `HealthManagement`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 9. State `Degraded`\n- **Covered**: There is a state `degraded` in `'health states'`.\n\n#### 10. State `Normal`\n- **Covered**: There is a state `normal` in `'health states'`.\n\n#### 11. Transition: `Off` to `Starting` triggered by `brakePedalPressed and startSignalReceived`\n- **Partially Covered**: In the generated model, the transition `'off-starting'` is from `off` to `starting`, triggered by `'Vehicle Start Signal'` and `if vehicle1_c1.'brake pedal depressed'`. This is semantically equivalent to the reference's trigger. **Covered**.\n\n#### 12. Transition: `Starting` to `Running` triggered by `vehicleOnSignal`\n- **Covered**: Transition `'starting-on'` from `starting` to `on`, triggered by `'Vehicle On Signal'`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 13. Transition: `Running` to `HealthManagement` triggered by `selfCheckComplete`\n- **Not Covered**: There is no explicit transition from `on` to `health states` or a trigger for `selfCheckComplete`. The model has `on` as a state, but the transition to health management is not explicit. **Not covered**.\n\n#### 14.

The generated model defines a part 'VehicleA' with the same attributes, but 'mass' is of type 'MassValue' instead of 'Real', and the class is named 'VehicleA' instead of 'Vehicle'. If we ignore naming and type differences as per the instructions, these can be considered supported.\n\nSo, **claims 12, 13, 14, 15** are supported.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

However, in `subsystemA.subsystem1`, `part1` is included. But in the reference, `SubsystemB` contains `part1`. In the generated model, this is not directly present. **Not covered**.\n18. `SubsystemB` contains `part2`. **Not covered** (see above).\n19. `SubsystemB` contains `part3`. **Covered**: In `subsystemA.subsystem2`, `part3` is included, but not in `SubsystemB`. In the generated model, `SubsystemB` is defined as `part5[1]`, so `part3` is not included. **Not covered**.\n20. `part3` in `SubsystemB` has port `p1`. **Not covered** (since `part3` is not included in `SubsystemB`).\n21. `SubsystemB` contains `part6`. **Covered**: In `subsystemB.subsystem4`, `part5` and `part6` are included. **Covered**.\n22. `SubsystemB` has port `p1`. **Not covered**: No explicit port `p1` on `SubsystemB` in the generated model.\n\n**Configuration Schemes:**\n23. `VehicleConfigA` defined as a configuration scheme. **Covered** (`part vehicleConfigA :> anyVehicleConfig { ... }`)\n24. `VehicleConfigA` includes `SubsystemA`. **Covered** (via `part :>> subsystemA = subsystemA.subsystem1;`)\n25. `VehicleConfigA` includes `SubsystemB`. **Covered** (via `part :>> subsystemB = subsystemB.subsystem3 { ... }`)\n26. `VehicleConfigB` defined as a configuration scheme. **Covered** (`part VehicleConfigB :> anyVehicleConfig { ... }`)\n27. `VehicleConfigB` includes `SubsystemA`. **Covered** (via `part :>> subsystemA = subsystemA.subsystem2;`)\n28. `VehicleConfigB` includes `SubsystemB`. **Covered** (via `part :>> subsystemB = subsystemB.subsystem4 { ... }`)\n\n**Constraints:**\n29. Constraint block `systemConstraints` defined. **Covered** (via `assert constraint { ... }`)\n30. Constraint: `SubsystemA.part4 == SubsystemB.part3`. **Not covered**: The generated model's constraint is about `subsystemA != subsystemA.subsystem2 | subsystemB == subsystemB.subsystem3`, which is not equivalent to the reference constraint.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\nLet's examine the generated model:\n\n```\npackage 'UnitSystemsStandard' {\n    private import ISQ::*;\n    private import USCustomaryUnits::*;\n}\n```\n\nThis model:\n- Declares a package named `UnitSystemsStandard`.\n- Imports `ISQ` and `USCustomaryUnits` (presumably packages or modules containing unit definitions).\n\nNow, let's check each claim:\n\n| # | Reference Claim | Covered? | Reason |\n|---|-----------------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Library named `UnitSystemLibrary` | ❌ | No library, only a package named differently. |\n| 2 | System named `UnitSystem` | ❌ | No explicit system definition. |\n| 3 | System contains components | ❌ | No explicit components in the package. |\n| 4 | Component `ISQUnit` | ❓ | Possibly covered by `import ISQ::*`, but not explicit. |\n| 5 | Component `USCustomaryUnit` | ❓ | Possibly covered by `import USCustomaryUnits::*`, but not explicit. |\n| 6 | `ISQUnit` has properties | ❓ | Not explicit, but possibly in imported content. |\n| 7 | ISQUnit base unit: length \"meter\" (1) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 8 | ISQUnit base unit: mass \"kilogram\" (2) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 9 | ISQUnit base unit: time \"second\" (3) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 10 | ISQUnit base unit: electricCurrent \"ampere\" (4) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 11 | ISQUnit base unit: thermodynamicTemperature \"kelvin\" (5) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 12 | ISQUnit base unit: amountOfSubstance \"mole\" (6) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 13 | ISQUnit base unit: luminousIntensity \"candela\" (7) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 14 | `USCustomaryUnit` has properties | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 15 | USCustomaryUnit base unit: length \"foot\" (1) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 16 | USCustomaryUnit base unit: mass \"pound\" (2) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 17 | USCustomaryUnit base unit: time \"second\" (3) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n| 18 | USCustomaryUnit base unit: electricCurrent \"ampere\" (4) | ❓ | Not explicit, possibly in import. |\n\n**Key point:** The generated model only imports two packages. It does not define any of the elements explicitly. Unless we assume the imported packages contain all the relevant definitions, the generated model does not explicitly cover any of the atomic claims.\n\nHowever, the task is to check if the generated model \"contains the same or equivalent element.\" Since the generated model only imports, and does not define, the elements, and we have no information about the contents of `ISQ` or `USCustomaryUnits`, we must be strict and say that the generated model does **not** cover any of the atomic claims explicitly.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

It does not specify implementation details, units, or specific individuals (like Iron, Carbon, etc.), but it does define the core concepts.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n| # | Claim | Supported? | Reasoning |\n|---|-------|------------|-----------|\n| 1 | Defines package 'MaterialScienceBase' | Irrelevant | Not modeled in reference; ignore. |\n| 2 | Imports ScalarValues::Real | Irrelevant | Not modeled in reference; ignore. |\n| 3 | Imports Quantities::* | Irrelevant | Not modeled in reference; ignore. |\n| 4 | Imports MeasurementReferences::* | Irrelevant | Not modeled in reference; ignore. |\n| 5 | Imports SI::* | Irrelevant | Not modeled in reference; ignore. |\n| 6 | Attribute AtomicMassValue :> MassValue | Supported | Reference defines AtomicMass as Real; this is equivalent. |\n| 7 | Attribute TensileStrengthUnit :> DerivedUnit | Supported | Reference defines TensileStrength with units; this is equivalent. |\n| 8 | TensileStrengthUnit has lengthPF: QuantityPowerFactor[1] (L, -1) | Supported | Reference specifies units; this is a detailed implementation. |\n| 9 | TensileStrengthUnit has massPF: QuantityPowerFactor[1] (M, 1) | Supported | As above. |\n| 10 | TensileStrengthUnit has durationPF: QuantityPowerFactor[1] (T, -2) | Supported | As above. |\n| 11 | TensileStrengthUnit has quantityDimension with quantityPowerFactors | Supported | As above. |\n| 12 | Attribute TensileStrengthValue :> ScalarQuantityValue | Supported | Reference defines TensileStrength as Real with units; this is equivalent. |\n| 13 | TensileStrengthValue has num: Real | Supported | Reference defines as Real. |\n| 14 | TensileStrengthValue has mRef: TensileStrengthUnit | Supported | Reference defines units for TensileStrength. |\n| 15 | Defines unit 'N/mm²' as TensileStrengthUnit = N / mm^2 | Supported | Reference specifies units as \"newtons per square millimeter\". |\n| 16 | Part Substance | Supported | Reference mentions \"substances, materials, and metals\". |\n| 17 | Part Material :> Substance | Supported | Reference mentions \"materials\". |\n| 18 | Part Metal :> Material | Supported | Reference mentions \"metals\". |\n| 19 | Metal has attribute atomicMass: AtomicMassValue[1] | Supported | Reference defines AtomicMass for metals. |\n| 20 | Attribute MaterialFraction | Supported | Reference mentions \"mass fractions of component materials in alloys\". |\n| 21 | MaterialFraction has ref material: Material[1] | Supported | Reference mentions component materials in alloys. |\n| 22 | MaterialFraction has attribute massFraction: MassFractionValue[1] | Supported | Reference defines MassFraction. |\n| 23 | Attribute MassFractionValue :> DimensionOneValue | Supported | Reference defines MassFraction as Real; this is equivalent. |\n| 24 | Part Alloy :> Material | Supported | Reference defines alloys as materials. |\n| 25 | Alloy has attribute fractions: MaterialFraction[2..*] | Supported | Reference mentions mass fractions of component materials in alloys. |\n| 26 | Individual Iron :> Metal | Not Supported | Reference does not define specific metals. |\n| 27 | Iron has attribute atomicMass = 55.845 [Da] | Not Supported | Reference does not define specific metals or their values. |\n| 28 | Individual Carbon :> Metal | Not Supported | As above. |\n| 29 | Carbon has attribute atomicMass = 12.011 [Da] | Not Supported | As above. |\n| 30 | Individual Manganese :> Metal | Not Supported | As above. |\n| 31 | Manganese has attribute atomicMass = 54.938 [Da] | Not Supported | As above. |\n| 32 | Individual Steel_980 :> Alloy | Not Supported | Reference does not define specific alloys. |\n| 33 | Steel_980 has fraction1 as fractions, referencing Iron, massFraction = 0.9862[one] | Not Supported | Reference does not define specific alloys or their composition. |\n| 34 | Steel_980 has fraction2 as fractions, referencing Carbon, massFraction = 0.9862[one] | Not Supported | As above. |\n| 35 | Steel_980 has fraction3 as fractions, referencing Manganese, massFraction = 0.9862[one] | Not Supported | As above. |\n| 36 | Steel_980 has tensileStrength: TensileStrengthValue = 980['N/mm²'] | Not Supported | Reference does not define specific alloys or their properties. |\n\n**Note:** Claims 1-5 are about imports and package structure, which are not modeled in the reference and can be ignored for the purposes of precision scoring.\n\n**Total atomic claims to consider:** 36 - 5 = 31 (claims 6-36).\n\n**Supported claims:** Claims 6-25 (20 claims) and 19-25 (7 more), so claims 6-25 (20 claims) and 16-25 (10 claims) overlap.

The generated model passes them as a parameter, but the structure is equivalent.\n\n6. **The action body (in Alf) iterates over 'sensors', checks 'sensor.ready', and calls 'Update(sensor)' if true.**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model's 'checkAndUpdateSensors()' method is not fully specified, but the sequence diagram shows 'checkAndUpdateSensors()' being called, and then 'check status' and 'updateSensor(sensor)' being invoked.

For each atomic claim in the generated model, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.\n\nLet's compare each claim to the reference model:\n\n1. **Package 'VehiclePowerManagement'**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model is named 'mySystem', not 'VehiclePowerManagement'.\n\n2. **Attribute def VehicleStartSignal**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model uses a trigger named 'startSignal', which is conceptually similar, but not explicitly defined as an attribute.\n\n3. **Attribute def VehicleOnSignal**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model uses 'startDoneSignal' as a trigger, which may correspond, but the name and explicit attribute definition do not match.\n\n4. **Attribute def VehicleOffSignal**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model uses 'shutdownSignal' as a trigger, which may correspond, but again, not explicitly defined as an attribute.\n\n5. **State type definition VehicleStates**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model defines states directly, not as a type.\n\n6. **State vehicleStates : VehicleStates**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model defines states 'shutdown', 'startUp', and 'run', but not a composite state or state variable.\n\n7. **Entry action in vehicleStates leading to off**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model defines an initial state 'shutdown', which is similar to 'off', but not named or structured the same way.\n\n8. **State off in vehicleStates**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model has a 'shutdown' state, which is conceptually similar to 'off'.\n\n9. **In state off, accept VehicleStartSignal then starting**  \n   - **Partially supported.** The reference model has a transition from 'shutdown' to 'startUp' triggered by 'startSignal', which is similar.\n\n10. **State starting in vehicleStates**  \n    - **Partially supported.** The reference model has a 'startUp' state, which is similar.\n\n11. **In state starting, accept VehicleOnSignal then on**  \n    - **Partially supported.** The reference model has a transition from 'startUp' to 'run' triggered by 'startDoneSignal', which is similar.\n\n12. **State on in vehicleStates**  \n    - **Partially supported.** The reference model has a 'run' state, which is similar.\n\n13. **In state on, accept VehicleOffSignal then off**  \n    - **Partially supported.** The reference model has a transition from 'run' to 'shutdown' triggered by 'shutdownSignal', which is similar.\n\n---\n\n#### Supported Claims\n\nTo be considered \"supported,\" the claim must be present in the reference model with equivalent structure and semantics, even if the names differ. Let's be strict but fair:\n\n- Claims 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: The states and transitions in the generated model correspond to the states and transitions in the reference model, though with different names. The structure (three states, transitions between them triggered by signals) is equivalent.\n- Claim 7: The initial state in both models is the \"off\"/\"shutdown\" state.\n- Claims 2, 3, 4: The triggers/signals are present in the reference model, though not as attributes.\n\nHowever, claims 1, 5, 6 are not supported (package name, state type, and state variable are not present in the reference model).\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- Claims 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: **9 claims** (allowing for name differences and focusing on structure/semantics).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

There are no concrete elements, parts, attributes, types, or relations defined.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- None of the atomic claims in the generated model are supported by the reference model, as the reference model does not define any of the elements, types, parts, events, items, actions, or occurrences present in the generated model.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model.\n\n**Reference Model:**\n```\nSystem mySystem\n{\n    // Define the system elements and interactions\n}\n```Block mySystem\n{\n    // Define the system elements and interactions\n}\n```Package mySystem\n{\n    // Define the system elements and interactions\n}\n...\n```\n\nHowever, the reference model as provided is a sequence of repeated, incomplete, or placeholder declarations:\n- `System mySystem { ... }`\n- `Block mySystem { ... }`\n- Multiple times: `Package mySystem { ... }`\n\nAll of them contain only comments: `// Define the system elements and interactions`\n\n**Atomic claims present:**\n- There is a system named `mySystem`.\n- There is a block named `mySystem`.\n- There is a package named `mySystem`. (repeated multiple times, but only one unique claim)\n\n**No actual elements, parts, attributes, types, or relations are defined.**  \nThe comments are placeholders and do not constitute atomic modeling claims.\n\n**So, the atomic claims are:**\n1.

For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n#### 1. The existence of a system named `mySystem`.\n- **Generated model:** The top-level element is `package 'CruiseControlSystemRealization' { ... }`\n- **Coverage:** The generated model defines a system, but with a different name. However, per instructions, naming differences can be ignored if the structure and semantics match.\n- **Conclusion:** The generated model defines a system (as a package), so this is covered.\n\n#### 2. The existence of a block named `mySystem`.\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit `Block mySystem`, but there are parts and blocks defined (e.g., `part def Driver;`, etc.). The top-level is a package, not a block.\n- **Conclusion:** The generated model does not define a block named `mySystem`, but it does define blocks/parts. However, since the reference model only claims the existence of a block named `mySystem` (with no further structure), and the generated model has a top-level package, not a block, this is **not covered**.\n\n#### 3. The existence of a package named `mySystem`.\n- **Generated model:** The top-level is a package, but named `CruiseControlSystemRealization`.\n- **Conclusion:** The generated model defines a package, so this is covered (ignoring naming).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The generated model does define a top-level system.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 2. Component `cruiseControlInterface`\n- **Generated model:** There is no component named `cruiseControlInterface`. The closest is `driver_b` and `driver`, which seem to represent the interface between the driver and the system, and `driverToVehicleInterface`. However, there is no explicit `cruiseControlInterface` component.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n#### 3. Component `cruiseController`\n- **Generated model:** There are parts named `CruiseController`, `cruiseController`, and `cruiseController_b`.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 4. Component `engine`\n- **Generated model:** There are parts named `Engine`, `engine`, and `engine_b`.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 5. `cruiseControlInterface` has port `setSpeedPort`\n- **Generated model:** No explicit `cruiseControlInterface` component, so this port is not present as such. There is a `setSpeedPort` on `driver_b` and `vehicle_b`, but not on a `cruiseControlInterface`.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n#### 6. `cruiseControlInterface` has port `speedSensorPort`\n- **Generated model:** As above, no such component or port.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n#### 7. `cruiseControlInterface` has port `fuelControlPort`\n- **Generated model:** As above, no such component or port.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n#### 8. `cruiseController` has port `setSpeedPort`\n- **Generated model:** `cruiseController_b` has a `setSpeedPort`.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 9. `cruiseController` has port `speedSensorPort`\n- **Generated model:** `cruiseController_b` has a `sensedSpeedPort`, which corresponds to `speedSensorPort` (naming difference only).\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 10. `cruiseController` has port `fuelControlPort`\n- **Generated model:** `cruiseController_b` has a `fuelCommandPort`, which corresponds to `fuelControlPort` (naming difference only).\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 11. `engine` has port `fuelControlPort`\n- **Generated model:** `engine_b` has a `fuelCommandPort`, which corresponds to `fuelControlPort`.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 12. Relationship type `connects`\n- **Generated model:** There are explicit connections/flows and interfaces, but not a named relationship type `connects`. However, the relationships are modeled via flows and interfaces.\n- **Covered:** Yes (structure is present, even if the name is not)\n\n#### 13. Connection: `cruiseControlInterface.setSpeedPort` → `cruiseController.setSpeedPort`\n- **Generated model:** There is a flow from `driver_b.setSpeedPort` to `vehicle_b.setSpeedPort`, and then to `cruiseController_b.setSpeedPort`. The `driverToVehicleInterface` connects `driver_b.setSpeedPort` to `vehicle_b.setSpeedPort`, and `vehicle_b.setSpeedPort` is bound to `cruiseController_b.setSpeedPort`. While the path is indirect, the connection is present.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n#### 14. Connection: `cruiseControlInterface.speedSensorPort` → `cruiseController.speedSensorPort`\n- **Generated model:** There is a flow from `speedometer_b.sensedSpeedPort` to `cruiseController_b.sensedSpeedPort`. The `speedometer` seems to play the role of the speed sensor, and the port names correspond. However, there is no `cruiseControlInterface` component, so the source is not present as such.\n- **Covered:** No\n\n#### 15. Connection: `cruiseController.fuelControlPort` → `engine.fuelControlPort`\n- **Generated model:** There is a flow from `cruiseController_b.fuelCommandPort` to `engine_b.fuelCommandPort`.\n- **Covered:** Yes\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The model defines a package named `MassRollup`.\n2. The model imports `NumericalFunctions::*`.\n3. There is a part definition `MassedThing`.\n4. `MassedThing` has an attribute `simpleMass` of type `ISQ::mass`.\n5. `MassedThing` has an attribute `totalMass` of type `ISQ::mass`.\n6. There is a part `simpleThing` that extends `MassedThing`.\n7. `simpleThing` defines `totalMass` as equal to `simpleMass`.\n8. There is a part `compositeThing` that extends `MassedThing`.\n9. `compositeThing` has a part `subcomponents` which is a collection (`[*]`) of `MassedThing`.\n10. `compositeThing` defines `totalMass` as `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`.\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n1. **Package definition (`MassRollup`)**  \n   - **Not supported**: The reference model uses a system, not a package, and the name is different. However, naming differences are to be ignored if the structure matches. The concept of a top-level container is present, so this is **supported**.\n\n2. **Import of `NumericalFunctions::*`**  \n   - **Not supported**: The reference model does not mention this import or any equivalent.\n\n3. **Definition of `MassedThing` part**  \n   - **Partially supported**: The reference model defines two types, `simpleThing` and `compositeThing`, both with `simpleMass` and `totalMass`. The generated model introduces a superclass (`MassedThing`) for these shared attributes, which is a structural abstraction not present in the reference. However, the attributes themselves are present. For the purpose of atomic claims, the existence of a base type is **not directly supported**.\n\n4. **`MassedThing` has attribute `simpleMass` of type `ISQ::mass`**  \n   - **Partially supported**: The reference model has `simpleMass : Real`. The type is different (`ISQ::mass` vs `Real`), but both represent a mass value. If we ignore type naming differences and focus on semantics, this is **supported**.\n\n5. **`MassedThing` has attribute `totalMass` of type `ISQ::mass`**  \n   - **Same as above**: **Supported**.\n\n6. **`simpleThing` extends `MassedThing`**  \n   - **Not supported**: The reference model does not have an explicit inheritance hierarchy, but `simpleThing` has the same attributes as `MassedThing`. The inheritance is an abstraction, but the structure matches. For atomic claims, the inheritance itself is **not supported**.\n\n7. **`simpleThing` defines `totalMass` as equal to `simpleMass`**  \n   - **Supported**: The reference model's behavior for `simpleThing` is `calculateTotalMass(thing : simpleThing) : Real { return thing.simpleMass }`, which is equivalent.\n\n8. **`compositeThing` extends `MassedThing`**  \n   - **Not supported**: Same reasoning as claim 6.\n\n9. **`compositeThing` has a part `subcomponents` which is a collection of `MassedThing`**  \n   - **Partially supported**: The reference model defines `subcomponents : set of simpleThing`. The generated model allows `subcomponents` to be any `MassedThing` (i.e., both `simpleThing` and `compositeThing`). The reference model only allows `simpleThing`. This is a generalization, so **not strictly supported**.\n\n10. **`compositeThing` defines `totalMass` as `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`**  \n    - **Supported**: The reference model's behavior for `compositeThing` is to sum the `totalMass` of all subcomponents and add its own `simpleMass`. The generated model expresses the same logic.\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- 1. Package definition: **Supported**\n- 2. Import: **Not supported**\n- 3.

System: **Covered** (semantic equivalence)\n2. mainVehicleComponents: **Not covered**\n3. chassis component: **Partially covered** (as attribute, not as part)\n4. chassis.weight: **Covered** (as attribute)\n5. engine component: **Covered**\n6. engine.weight: **Covered**\n7. transmission component: **Covered**\n8. transmission.weight: **Covered**\n9. totalWeight property: **Partially covered** (implicit in constraint)\n10. weightLimit property: **Covered**\n11. checkWeight interaction: **Partially covered** (as constraint)\n12. sum calculation: **Covered**\n13. warning on excess: **Partially covered** (constraint, but no explicit warning)\n\nLet's be strict and count only *fully* covered or *clearly semantically equivalent* claims as covered:\n\n- 1.

However, there is no explicit property named \"MyEngineVariant\" of type String.\n   - **Covered.** (Semantically, the variants are present.)\n\n3. **Property \"CylinderDiameter\" of type String with values \"70mm\", \"100mm\".**  \n   - **Covered.** The generated model has a variation attribute def \"DiameterChoices\" with variant attributes diameterSmall = 70[mm] and diameterLarge = 100[mm].\n\n4. **Property \"CylinderQuantity\" of type Integer with min 4 and max 6.**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model defines part \"cylinder\" in \"Engine\" as Cylinder[2..*], and then redefines in '4cylEngine' and '6cylEngine' as cylinder[4] and cylinder[6]. The min/max is not explicitly 4/6 in the base definition, but the variants are 4 and 6.\n   - **Covered.** (The variants cover the allowed quantities.)\n\n5. **Type \"MyEngineType\" with attributes \"CylinderQuantity\" (Integer) and \"CylinderDiameter\" (String).**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model defines \"Engine\" as a part with part \"cylinder : Cylinder[2..*]\", and \"Cylinder\" has attribute \"diameter\". The \"CylinderQuantity\" is implicit in the number of cylinders, and \"CylinderDiameter\" is an attribute of Cylinder. The type structure is present, though not as a flat type with two attributes.\n   - **Covered.** (Equivalent structure.)\n\n6. **Instance \"MyFourCylinderEngine\" of type \"MyEngineType\" with CylinderQuantity = 4 and CylinderDiameter = \"70mm\".**  \n   - **Covered.** The generated model has part '4cylEngine' : Engine with part redefines cylinder[4], and the diameter can be set via the variation attribute diameterSmall = 70[mm].\n\n7. **Instance \"MySixCylinderEngine\" of type \"MyEngineType\" with CylinderQuantity = 6 and CylinderDiameter = \"70mm\".**  \n   - **Covered.** The generated model has part '6cylEngine' : Engine with part redefines cylinder[6], and the diameter can be set via the variation attribute diameterSmall = 70[mm].\n\n8. **Configuration \"MyEngineConfig\".**  \n   - **Not covered.** There is no explicit configuration named \"MyEngineConfig\" in the generated model.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n- Covered: 1 (system), 2 (variant), 3 (diameter), 4 (quantity), 5 (type), 6 (4cyl instance), 7 (6cyl instance) = **7**\n- Not covered: 8 (explicit configuration)\n\n**Score: 7/8**"
