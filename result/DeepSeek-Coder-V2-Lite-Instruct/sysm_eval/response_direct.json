While there is no explicit `HealthManagement` state, the `health states` region itself corresponds to health management. **Covered** (by structural equivalence).\n\n5. **Maintenance**  \n   - **Covered**: The generated model defines a state `maintenance` within `health states`.\n\n6. **Degraded**  \n   - **Covered**: The generated model defines a state `degraded` within `health states`.\n\n7. **Normal**  \n   - **Covered**: The generated model defines a state `normal` within `health states`.\n\n### **Transitions**\n\n8. **startUp: Off → Starting when brakePedalPressed and startSignalReceived**  \n   - **Covered**: The generated model has a transition `'off-starting'` from `off` to `starting`, triggered by `'Vehicle Start Signal'` and a guard `if vehicle1_c1.'brake pedal depressed'`, and sends `'Start Signal'` to the controller. This matches the reference's trigger conditions.\n\n9. **startRunning: Starting → Running when vehicleOnSignalReceived**  \n   - **Covered**: The generated model has a transition `'starting-on'` from `starting` to `on`, triggered by `'Vehicle On Signal'`.\n\n10. **performSelfChecks: Running → HealthManagement**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: The generated model does not have a direct transition from `on` (Running) to `health states` (HealthManagement). However, the `on` state has an entry action `'perform self test'`, which may correspond to self-checks, but there is no explicit transition to a `HealthManagement` state.  \n    - **Not Covered** (no direct transition from Running to HealthManagement).\n\n11. **switchToMaintenance: Running → Maintenance**  \n    - **Covered**: In the generated model, from `normal` (in `health states`), there is a transition to `maintenance` triggered by `maintenanceTime`. While the reference model transitions from `Running` to `Maintenance`, the generated model transitions from `normal` (in health states) to `maintenance`. The mapping is not exact, but the intent (transition to maintenance state) is present.  \n    - **Covered** (by structural equivalence).\n\n12. **switchToDegraded: Running → Degraded when temperatureExceedsThreshold**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model has a transition from `normal` to `degraded` in `health states`, triggered by `'sense temperature'.temp > vehicle1_c1.Tmax`, which matches the temperature threshold condition.\n\n13. **switchToNormal: Degraded → Normal when restoreToNormalSignalReceived**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model has a transition from `degraded` to `normal` triggered by `'Return to Normal'`.\n\n### **Behaviors**\n\n14. **Behavior startUp invokes startUp transition**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model has an entry action in the `off` state and a transition to `starting` with the appropriate triggers, and the `provide power` action is performed in the `on` state. The explicit behavior invocation is not modeled as a separate behavior, but the effect is present in the state machine.  \n    - **Covered** (by effect).\n\n15. **Behavior startRunning (declaration)**  \n    - **Not Covered**: There is no explicit behavior named `startRunning` in the generated model.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count:\n\n- **States**: 7 claims, all covered (with some structural equivalence).\n- **Transitions**: 6 claims, 5 covered, 1 not covered (no direct Running → HealthManagement transition).\n- **Behaviors**: 2 claims, 1 covered, 1 not covered (no explicit `startRunning` behavior).\n\n**Total claims:** 7 (states) + 6 (transitions) + 2 (behaviors) = **15**\n\n**Covered claims:** 7 (states) + 5 (transitions) + 1 (behavior) = **13**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Score**\n\n**Score: 13/15**"

List all atomic modeling claims made by the reference system model\n\nFrom the reference model, we extract the following atomic claims:\n\n### System and Components\n1. There is a system called `mySystem`.\n2. The system has components: `Engine`, `Transmission`, `Wheels`.\n\n### Engine Component\n3. There is a component called `Engine`.\n4. `Engine` has a property `CylinderCount` with range 4, 6.\n5. `Engine` has a property `Type` with type Enum { \"4-cylinder\", \"6-cylinder\" }.\n6. `Engine` has a constraint: compatibility with Transmission and Wheels, based on CylinderCount.\n\n### Transmission Component\n7. There is a component called `Transmission`.\n8. `Transmission` has a property `Type` with type Enum { \"Manual\", \"Automatic\" }.\n9. `Transmission` has a constraint: compatibility with Engine and Wheels.\n\n### Wheels Component\n10. There is a component called `Wheels`.\n11. `Wheels` has properties and constraints (not specified in detail).\n\n### Relationships and Constraints\n12. There are relationships and constraints between components (general claim).\n\n### System Behavior and Interactions\n13. The system defines behavior and interactions (general claim).\n\n---\n\n## 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n### 1. There is a system called `mySystem`.\n- **Generated model**: The top-level package is `VehicleProductLineConfigurationSystem`, with a main part `vehicle`. The naming is different, but the structure is equivalent.\n- **Covered**: Yes.\n\n### 2. The system has components: `Engine`, `Transmission`, `Wheels`.\n- **Generated model**: `Engine`, `Transmission`, and `Wheel` are defined as parts/components.\n- **Covered**: Yes.\n\n### 3. There is a component called `Engine`.\n- **Generated model**: `part def Engine;`\n- **Covered**: Yes.\n\n### 4. `Engine` has a property `CylinderCount` with range 4, 6.\n- **Generated model**: There is no explicit property `CylinderCount` on `Engine`. However, there are variant parts: `'4CylEngine'` and `'6CylEngine'`, which are subtypes of `Engine`. The selection between these variants is used in constraints and configuration.\n- **Covered**: Equivalent modeling via variant parts instead of a property. **Yes**.\n\n### 5. `Engine` has a property `Type` with type Enum { \"4-cylinder\", \"6-cylinder\" }.\n- **Generated model**: Again, the distinction between \"4-cylinder\" and \"6-cylinder\" is modeled via variant parts, not an explicit property.

The name is different (`mass` vs `vehicleMass`), and the type is more specific (`MassValue` instead of `Integer`), but the semantics are equivalent.  \n   - **Covered**\n\n6. **`Vehicle.fuelStatus : String`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: The generated model has `fuelLevel: Real` and `fuelTankCapacity: Real`, but no `fuelStatus` or equivalent string property.  \n   - **Not Covered**\n\n7. **`Vehicle.powertrain : String`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No `powertrain` property or equivalent in the generated model.  \n   - **Not Covered**\n\n8. **`Vehicle.reliability : String`**  \n   - **Not Covered**: No `reliability` property or equivalent in the generated model.  \n   - **Not Covered**\n\n9. **`Engine.outputTorque : Integer`**  \n   - **Partially Covered**: The generated model defines an action `'generate torque'` for `Engine`, but not a property `outputTorque`. The action may be related, but it's not a property.  \n   - **Not Covered**\n\n10. **`Engine.driveInterface : String`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: The generated model defines a `drivePwrPort` port for `Engine` and an interface `EngineToTransmissionInterface`, which is a more structured way to model an interface. This is a semantic match for an interface, though not a string property.  \n    - **Covered**\n\n11. **`Transmission.powerDelivery : String`**  \n    - **Partially Covered**: The generated model defines a `clutchPort` for `Transmission`, which may be related to power delivery, but there is no explicit property.  \n    - **Not Covered**\n\n### Relationships\n12. **Relationship `connects` (Vehicle → Engine)**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model connects `engine_v1.drivePwrPort` to `transmission.clutchPort` within a `Vehicle` instance, and the interface is defined. While the connection is between Engine and Transmission, not Vehicle and Engine, the `Vehicle` part contains an `Engine` part, and the connection is established in the context of the vehicle. There is no explicit Vehicle→Engine connection, but the composition and usage context are present.  \n    - **Partially Covered**: Since the reference is explicit Vehicle→Engine, and the generated model only has Vehicle containing Engine, but not a direct connection, this is **Not Covered**.\n\n13. **Relationship `manages` (Vehicle → Transmission)**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model has `Vehicle` containing a `Transmission` part, which is a containment relationship (stronger than \"manages\").  \n    - **Covered**\n\n### Requirements\n14. **Requirement `vehicleMassRequirement` targeting `Vehicle` (description: manage vehicle mass specifications)**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model has `MassLimitationRequirement` and requirements `vehicleMass1`, `vehicleMass2` targeting `Vehicle` and specifying mass constraints.  \n    - **Covered**\n\n15. **`vehicleMassRequirement` condition: \"Each vehicle reflects its actual mass and complies with the corresponding maximum mass limitations to prevent overloading.\"**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model has constraints like `massActual <= massReqd` and assigns `massActual = vehicle.mass`, which matches the intent.  \n    - **Covered**\n\n16. **Requirement `fuelStatusRequirement` targeting `Vehicle` (description: regulate fuel status)**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model includes constraints on `fuelLevel` and `fuelTankCapacity` in the requirements, e.g., `vehicle.fuelLevel >= vehicle.fuelTankCapacity`.  \n    - **Covered**\n\n17. **`fuelStatusRequirement` condition: \"Some vehicles must meet mass requirements when fully fueled.\"**  \n    - **Covered**: The generated model encodes this as an assumption/constraint: `vehicle.fuelLevel >= vehicle.fuelTankCapacity` in the requirement.  \n    - **Covered**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n| # | Claim | Covered? |\n|---|-------|----------|\n| 1 | System | ✔️ |\n| 2 | Vehicle | ✔️ |\n| 3 | Engine | ✔️ |\n| 4 | Transmission | ✔️ |\n| 5 | Vehicle.vehicleMass | ✔️ |\n| 6 | Vehicle.fuelStatus | ❌ |\n| 7 | Vehicle.powertrain | ❌ |\n| 8 | Vehicle.reliability | ❌ |\n| 9 | Engine.outputTorque | ❌ |\n|10 | Engine.driveInterface | ✔️ |\n|11 | Transmission.powerDelivery | ❌ |\n|12 | connects (Vehicle→Engine) | ❌ |\n|13 | manages (Vehicle→Transmission) | ✔️ |\n|14 | vehicleMassRequirement (desc) | ✔️ |\n|15 | vehicleMassRequirement (cond) | ✔️ |\n|16 | fuelStatusRequirement (desc) | ✔️ |\n|17 | fuelStatusRequirement (cond) | ✔️ |\n\n**Number of covered claims: 11/17**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nScore: 11/17**"

However, req3 has a doc string: \"Alarm when battery has sank\", which is related to battery alerting, but not the overall system safety.\n\n12. **\"Ensure High Reliability and Safety\" has a Description**  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n13. **Contains Requirement \"Battery Status Detection\"**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model has requirements, but none are named \"Battery Status Detection\".

For each atomic claim, determine coverage in the generated model\n\n**1. The system is named `Car`.**  \n- **Covered.** The generated model has `Vehicle_1` and `Vehicle_2` as top-level parts, which represent the car.\n\n**2. The car has a mass of 1200 kilograms.**  \n- **Covered.** Both `Vehicle_1` and `Vehicle_2` have `mass: MassValue = 1200 [kg]`.\n\n**3. The car has a length of 4.82 meters.**  \n- **Covered.** Both `Vehicle_1` and `Vehicle_2` have `length: LengthValue = 4.82 [m]`.\n\n**4. The car contains 4 `WheelAssembly` parts.**  \n- **Covered.** `Vehicle_2` has `part wheelAssy : WheelAssy[4];`.\n\n**5. Each `WheelAssembly` contains parts: `Rim`, `Tire`, `BrakeDisc`.**  \n- **Partially covered.**  \n    - `WheelAssy` in the generated model contains `part wheel : Wheel[1];` and `part discBrakeAssy : DiscBrakeAssy[1];` (corresponds to `BrakeDisc`).  \n    - `Rim` is not explicitly modeled as a part; its property is merged into `Wheel` as `hubDiameter`.  \n    - `Tire` is a part of `Wheel` (`part tire: Tire[1];`), not directly of `WheelAssy`.  \n    - **Conclusion:** The structure is equivalent, though the nesting is different. **Covered.**\n\n**6. The `Rim` has a property `diameter` of 18 inches.**  \n- **Covered.** `Wheel` has `hubDiameter: LengthValue = 18 ['in'];` (semantically equivalent to `Rim.diameter`).\n\n**7. The `Tire` has a property `width` of 245 millimeters.**  \n- **Covered.** `Wheel` has `width: LengthValue = 245 [mm];` (though it's on `Wheel`, but the context is the same).\n\n**8. The `Tire` has a property `height` of 45 millimeters.**  \n- **Covered.** `Tire` has `height: LengthValue = 45 [mm];`.\n\n**9. The `Tire` has a property `outerDiameter` calculated as `Tire.width * 2 + Tire.height * 2`.**  \n- **Partially covered.**  \n    - `Wheel` has `outerDiameter: LengthValue = (hubDiameter + 2 * tire.height) [mm];`.  \n    - The formula is different: reference model uses `Tire.width * 2 + Tire.height * 2`, generated model uses `hubDiameter + 2 * tire.height`.  \n    - **Not covered** (the calculation is not equivalent).\n\n**10. The `Tire` has a property `treadDepth` of 6.0 millimeters.**  \n- **Covered.** `Tire` has `profileDepth: LengthValue default 6.0 [mm];` (naming difference, but semantically equivalent).\n\n**11. There is a constraint: `treadDepth` must not be less than 3.5 millimeters.**  \n- **Covered.** `Tire` has `constraint hasLegalProfileDepth {profileDepth >= 3.5 [mm]}`.\n\n**12. The `BrakeDisc` is a part of each `WheelAssembly`.**  \n- **Covered.** `WheelAssy` has `part discBrakeAssy : DiscBrakeAssy[1];`.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Ports**\n4. **`CruiseController.SpeedPort : RealPort`**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The generated model does not explicitly define ports, but it does define events/messages for sensed speed, which may correspond to this port.\n5. **`CruiseController.SetSpeedPort : RealPort`**  \n   - **Partially covered.** Similarly, the event/message for set speed may correspond to this port.\n6. **`CruiseController.ThrottleCommandPort : RealPort`**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The event/message for fuel command may correspond to this port.\n7. **`EngineSystem.ThrottleInputPort : RealPort`**  \n   - **Partially covered.** The event/message for fuel command received may correspond to this port.\n\n**C. Operations**\n8. **`CruiseController.GenerateThrottleCommand` operation**  \n   - **Not covered.** No operation or function is defined in the generated model.\n9. **`EngineSystem.Adjust` operation**  \n   - **Not covered.** No operation or function is defined in the generated model.\n\n**D.

But since the system name is not essential to the structure, we can ignore naming. However, the generated model is a package, not a system. Let's be strict: **No**. |\n| 2 | Part: Vehicle | **Yes** | `part def Vehicle` exists. |\n| 3 | Vehicle.Mass : Integer | **Partial** | Attribute `mass` exists, but type is `Real` not `Integer`. |\n| 4 | Vehicle.State : String | **Partial** | There is a `status` attribute, but it's of type `VehicleStatus`, not `String`. |\n| 5 | Vehicle.State values: {\"Initial\", \"Updated\"} | **No** | No enumeration or value set for `status` or `State` in generated model. |\n| 6 | Vehicle.GearSetting : Integer | **Yes** | `gearSetting : Integer` exists in `VehicleStatus`. |\n| 7 | Vehicle.AcceleratorPosition : Real | **Yes** | `acceleratorPosition : Real` exists in `VehicleStatus`. |\n| 8 | Instance: Vehicle_1 is Vehicle | **Yes** | `individual part def Vehicle_1 :> Vehicle` exists. |\n| 9 | Vehicle_1.Mass = 2000 (initial) | **Yes** | In `vehicle_1_t0`, `mass = 2000.0` (type difference, but value matches). |\n| 10 | Vehicle_1.State = \"Initial\" (initial) | **No** | No value for `status` or `State` in `vehicle_1_t0` matches \"Initial\". |\n| 11 | Vehicle_1.GearSetting = 0 (initial) | **Yes** | In `vehicle_1_t0.status`, `gearSetting = 0`. |\n| 12 | Vehicle_1.AcceleratorPosition = 0.0 (initial) | **Yes** | In `vehicle_1_t0.status`, `acceleratorPosition = 0.0`. |\n| 13 | Vehicle_1.Mass = 1500 (updated) | **Yes** | In `vehicle_1_t1`, `mass = 1500.0`. |\n| 14 | Vehicle_1.State = \"Updated\" (updated) | **No** | No value for `status` or `State` in `vehicle_1_t1` matches \"Updated\". |\n| 15 | Vehicle_1.GearSetting = 2 (updated) | **Yes** | In `vehicle_1_t1.status`, `gearSetting = 2`. |\n| 16 | Vehicle_1.AcceleratorPosition = 0.5 (updated) | **Yes** | In `vehicle_1_t1.status`, `acceleratorPosition = 0.5`. |\n\nLet's clarify the partials:\n\n- Claim 3: Type mismatch (`Integer` vs `Real`). Since the value is always an integer, and the generated model uses `Real`, but the semantics are close, let's count as **covered**.\n- Claim 4: Attribute `State` is replaced by `status : VehicleStatus`, which is a structure, not a string. The reference model uses a string with two possible values; the generated model uses a structure with two attributes. This is **not equivalent**. So, **not covered**.\n- Claim 5: No enumeration or value set for `status` or `State`. **Not covered**.\n\nSo, the final coverage is:\n\n| # | Covered? |\n|---|----------|\n| 1 | No |\n| 2 | Yes |\n| 3 | Yes |\n| 4 | No |\n| 5 | No |\n| 6 | Yes |\n| 7 | Yes |\n| 8 | Yes |\n| 9 | Yes |\n|10 | No |\n|11 | Yes |\n|12 | Yes |\n|13 | Yes |\n|14 | No |\n|15 | Yes |\n|16 | Yes |\n\n**Total covered: 11/16**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### 1. There is a type called `Component` (base class).\n\n- **Generated Model:** There is a `part def MassedThing` and `part def CarPart :> MassedThing`. `CarPart` is used as a base for car parts. There is no explicit `Component` class, but `MassedThing` and `CarPart` serve a similar purpose.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (equivalent abstraction).\n\n#### 2. There is a type called `Vehicle` that is a kind of `Component`.\n\n- **Generated Model:** There is a `part car: CarPart :> compositeThing`. `car` is a `CarPart` and also a `compositeThing` (which is a `MassedThing` with subcomponents). This is equivalent to a `Vehicle` as a specialized `Component`.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (semantically equivalent).\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has an attribute `VIN` of type `String`.\n\n- **Generated Model:** `car` has an attribute `vin :>> serialNumber`, and `CarPart` has `serialNumber: String`. So, `vin` is mapped to `serialNumber`, which is a `String`.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (via mapping).\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle` has an attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n\n- **Generated Model:** `MassedThing` has `simpleMass :> ISQ::mass`, and `car` (as a `MassedThing`) has `simpleMass`. The type is not `Real` but a mass type, which is more specific.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (semantically equivalent).\n\n#### 5. `Vehicle` has a relationship `components` which is a set of `Component`.\n\n- **Generated Model:** `compositeThing` has `subcomponents: MassedThing[*]`, and `car` has `carParts: CarPart[*] :>> subcomponents`. This is a set of parts/components.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (semantically equivalent).\n\n#### 6. `Vehicle` has an operation `addComponent(component: Component)` that adds a component to the `components` set.\n\n- **Generated Model:** There is no explicit `addComponent` operation. The model defines the structure (parts/subcomponents), but not an operation to add components at runtime.\n- **Coverage:** **No** (operation missing).\n\n#### 7. `Vehicle` has an operation `calculateTotalMass(): Real` that:\n    - Initializes `totalMass` to `mass`.\n    - Iterates over each `component` in `components`.\n    - Adds `component.mass` to `totalMass`.\n    - Returns `totalMass`.\n\n- **Generated Model:** `compositeThing` defines `totalMass` as `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`, which is a declarative equivalent of the operation. The calculation is present, though as an attribute rather than an explicit operation.\n- **Coverage:** **Yes** (semantically equivalent).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

The generated model defines \"Automobile\" as a part. \"Car\" and \"Automobile\" are semantically equivalent. **Supported**.\n5. **Alias \"Car\" for \"Automobile\"**: The reference model defines \"Car\" as the main name, with alias \"汽车 (Car)\". The generated model defines \"Automobile\" as the main name, with alias \"Car\". The aliasing is present, though the direction is reversed. Since the intent is to provide both names, **Supported**.\n6. **Alias \"Torque\" for ISQ::TorqueValue**: The reference model defines \"Torque\" as a PhysicalQuantity associated with Car. The generated model defines an alias \"Torque\" for ISQ::TorqueValue.
