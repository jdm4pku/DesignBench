Functional Requirement: The vehicle initiates the startup process from the shutdown state when both the brake pedal is pressed and a start signal is received.\n- **Generated model:** In the 'vehicle states', the transition 'off-starting' requires 'Vehicle Start Signal' and `vehicle1_c1.'brake pedal depressed'` to transition from 'off' to 'starting', and sends 'Start Signal' to the controller.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 6. Functional Requirement: The vehicle completes self-inspection and power supply procedures after meeting the requirements.\n- **Generated model:** In the 'on' state, the entry action is 'perform self test' and 'provide power' is performed.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 7. Non-Functional Requirement: The vehicle can sense temperature in real time.\n- **Generated model:** There is an action 'sense temperature' with output 'temp', and in the 'health states', 'sense temperature' is performed.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 8. Non-Functional Requirement: The vehicle sends a warning signal to the vehicle controller when overheating is detected.\n- **Generated model:** In the 'normal-degraded' transition, when 'sense temperature'.temp > Tmax, 'Over Temp' is sent to the vehicle controller.\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 9. Non-Functional Requirement: The vehicle switches the vehicle status to [incomplete].\n- **Generated model:** The requirement is incomplete in the reference, so we do not count it.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Definition of part `Vehicle_1`.\n- **Not supported.** The reference model defines `mySystem` and `myCar`, but not a `Vehicle_1`.\n\n#### 2. `Vehicle_1` has attribute `mass` of type `MassValue`, default 1200 [kg].\n- **Not supported.** No such attribute in the reference model.\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle_1` has attribute `length` of type `LengthValue`, default 4.82 [m].\n- **Not supported.**\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle_1` has part `leftFrontWheel` of type `Wheel`.\n- **Not supported.** The reference model has `myWheels` containing `myWheelAssembly` containing `myWheel`, but not a direct mapping to `leftFrontWheel`.\n\n#### 5. `Vehicle_1` has part `rightFrontWheel` of type `Wheel`.\n- **Not supported.**\n\n#### 6. Definition of part `Wheel`.\n- **Supported.** The reference model has `myWheel`.\n\n#### 7. `Wheel` has attribute `hubDiameter` of type `LengthValue`, default 18 ['in'].\n- **Supported.** `myWheel` has `myRimDiameter` of type Integer, unit \"inch\", default 18.

The constraint is not explicit, but the minimum is modeled. **Let's count as supported.**\n\n#### 14. `Tire` has attribute `height` of type `LengthValue`, default 45 [mm].\n- **Supported.** `myWheel` has `myTireHeight` of type Integer, unit \"mm\", default 45.\n\n#### 15. Definition of constraint `DiscBrakeConstraint` (for all wheelAssy: 2 * w.discBrakeAssy.radius < w.wheel.outerDiameter).\n- **Not supported.** The reference model is incomplete (truncated), but up to the visible part, there is no mention of disc brakes or such constraints.\n\n#### 16. Definition of constraint `DiscBrakeFitConstraint_Alt` (2 * discBrakeAssy.radius < wheel.outerDiameter).\n- **Not supported.**\n\n#### 17.

There is a class named **Tire**.\n2. **Tire** has an attribute **manufacturer** of type **String**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: true.\n3. **Tire** has an attribute **rimDiameter** of type **Integer**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: false.\n4. **Tire** has an attribute **tireWidth** of type **Integer**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: false.\n5. **Tire** has an attribute **installationPosition** of type **Tuple**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: false.

For each atomic claim in the reference model, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1.

This is semantically equivalent to a class/record/struct in many modeling languages.\n- **Covered:** **Yes** (naming difference is allowed).\n\n#### 2. **Tire** has an attribute **manufacturer** of type **String**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: true.\n\n- **Generated model:** `attribute manufacturer: String;` in **TireInfo**.\n- **Covered:** **Yes** (no multiplicity or uniqueness specified, but default for String attributes is usually unique).\n\n#### 3. **Tire** has an attribute **rimDiameter** of type **Integer**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: false.\n\n- **Generated model:** `attribute hubDiameter: LengthValue;` in **TireInfo**. `LengthValue` is defined as a subtype of Real, and in the example, it is assigned a value in inches (18.0['in']). The reference model uses **rimDiameter** of type **Integer**; the generated model uses **hubDiameter** of type **LengthValue** (Real).\n- **Covered:** **Partially**. The attribute is present (hubDiameter vs. rimDiameter), but the type is different (Integer vs. Real/LengthValue), and the name is different. However, the semantics are close (both refer to a diameter of the rim/hub). For recall, we typically count close semantic matches, especially since units are often modeled as Real with units rather than Integer. **Let's count this as covered.**\n\n#### 4. **Tire** has an attribute **tireWidth** of type **Integer**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: false.\n\n- **Generated model:** `attribute width: Integer;` in **TireInfo**.\n- **Covered:** **Yes** (name difference, but clear semantic match).\n\n#### 5. **Tire** has an attribute **installationPosition** of type **Tuple**, isOrdered: false, isUnique: false.\n\n- **Generated model:** `attribute placement: PositionVector[0..1];` in **TireInfo**. `PositionVector` is defined as a structure with x, y, z coordinates (all Real).\n- **Covered:** **Yes** (name difference, but both represent a position/placement as a tuple/structure).\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For claim 6, since there is no attribute, but the number of cylinders is represented by the number of cylinder parts, and specific engines have 4 or 6 cylinders, this is a structural equivalent. Per instructions, if the structure and semantics match, it's covered.\n\nSo, let's count claim 6 as **covered**.\n\nClaim 5 (\"VehicleConfiguration\" class) is not present as a separate class/part; the \"vehicleFamily\" part is the closest, but it's not a configuration object per se, but a family. The configuration is represented by the combination of engine and transmission in \"vehicleFamily\", so arguably, the configuration concept is present, but not as a separate class. Given the instructions, this is **not covered**.\n\n**Final Tally:**\n\n- Total claims: 11\n- Covered: 10 (claims 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11)\n- Not covered: 1 (claim 5)\n\n---\n\n**Score: 10/11**"

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model.\n\n#### 1. There is a package named SafetyCompliance.\n- **Not covered.** The generated model's top-level package is 'VehicleSafetyCompliance', which is not equivalent.\n\n#### 2. SafetyCompliance contains a package named SafetyFeatures.\n- **Partially covered.** There is a package 'Safety Features' in the generated model, but it's not nested under 'SafetyCompliance'. For recall, we focus on the existence of the package, so **covered**.\n\n#### 3. SafetyCompliance contains a package named MandatorySafetyFeatures.\n- **Partially covered.** There is a package 'Mandatory Safety Features' in the generated model, but not nested. For recall, **covered**.\n\n#### 4. SafetyFeatures contains a component named mandatorySeatBelts1 with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Covered.** The generated model has 'seatBelt[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}' in 'interior', and the 'Safety Features' package imports all parts with @Safety. The two seat belts correspond to mandatorySeatBelts1 and mandatorySeatBelts2.\n\n#### 5. SafetyFeatures contains a component named mandatorySeatBelts2 with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Covered.** See above.\n\n#### 6. SafetyFeatures contains a component named driverAirbag with stereotype @Safety.\n- **Covered.** 'driverAirBag {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}' is present.\n\n#### 7. SafetyFeatures contains a component named bumper with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Covered.** 'bumper {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}' is present.\n\n#### 8. SafetyFeatures contains a component named keylessEntry with stereotype @Safety.\n- **Partially covered.** 'keylessEntry' is present, but no explicit @Safety stereotype. However, since 'Safety Features' filters by @Safety, and 'keylessEntry' is not annotated, **not covered**.\n\n#### 9. SafetyFeatures contains a package named WheelAssembly.\n- **Covered.** 'wheelAssy' part exists, and 'Safety Features' package exists, but not as a nested package. However, the structure is present as a part, not a package. For recall, **covered**.\n\n#### 10. WheelAssembly contains a component named wheel1 with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Partially covered.** 'wheel[2]' exists in 'wheelAssy', but no @Safety annotation. Only 'antilockBrakes[2]' has @Safety. So, **not covered**.\n\n#### 11. WheelAssembly contains a component named wheel2 with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Not covered.** See above.\n\n#### 12. WheelAssembly contains a component named abs with stereotype @Safety.\n- **Partially covered.** 'antilockBrakes[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = false;}}' is present, which is likely equivalent to 'abs @Safety'. So, **covered**.\n\n#### 13. MandatorySafetyFeatures contains a component named mandatorySeatBelts1 with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Covered.** 'Mandatory Safety Features' package filters for @Safety and isMandatory, and 'seatBelt[2] {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}' exists.\n\n#### 14. MandatorySafetyFeatures contains a component named mandatorySeatBelts2 with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Covered.** See above.\n\n#### 15. MandatorySafetyFeatures contains a component named bumper with stereotype @Safety and isMandatory = true.\n- **Covered.** 'bumper {@Safety{isMandatory = true;}}' exists and is imported into 'Mandatory Safety Features'.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
