Individual 'Temporal-Spatial Reference_ID1': **Not in reference model.**\n16. Individual 'VehicleRoadContext_ID1': **Not in reference model.**\n17. Individual 'VehicleA_ID1': **Reference model does not define individuals, but this is a standard instance.**\n18. Individual 'Road_ID1': **Reference model does not define individuals, but this is a standard instance.**\n\n#### 'Values'\n19-37. All value attributes (t0, t1, tn, m, p0, etc.): **Reference model does not define these as attributes, but these are values for simulation parameters. The reference model allows for such values in the context of simulation, but does not define them as attributes.**\n\n#### 'Individuals and Snapshots'\n38. Individual 'reference' as 'Temporal-Spatial Reference_ID1': **Not in reference model.**\n39. 'reference' contains snapshot 'context_t0' of 'VehicleRoadContext_ID1': **Not in reference model.**\n40. 'context_t0' has attribute 't' set to 't0': **Not in reference model.**\n41.

'vehicle_ID1_t0' exhibits state 'vehicleStates.on': **Reference model's 'Snapshot' has 'vehicleState: VehicleState', so this is supported.**\n47. 'context_t0' contains snapshot 'road_ID1_t0' of 'Road_ID1': **Reference model's 'Snapshot' has 'road: Road', so this is supported.**\n48-49. 'road_ID1_t0' has 'angle', 'surfaceFriction' set: **Reference model's 'Road' has 'slope: Angle' and 'frictionCoefficient: Real'; close, but not exact.**\n50-71. The same pattern repeats for t1 and tn: **Same as above.**\n\nLet's summarize the mapping:\n\n- The generated model introduces new parts ('Temporal-Spatial Reference', 'VehicleRoadContext') and individuals, which are not in the reference model.\n- The 'VehicleA' part is equivalent to 'Vehicle', but the types for position, velocity, acceleration are simplified to Real instead of structured types (Coordinate, Velocity, Acceleration).\n- The state machine for vehicle states is similar to the enum in the reference model, but not identical.\n- The 'Road' part's attributes are similar but not named or typed identically.\n- The value attributes are not present in the reference model as attributes, but are implied as simulation parameters.\n- The snapshot structure is more explicit in the reference model (as an item def 'Snapshot'), while the generated model uses nested individuals and snapshots.\n\n**Supported claims:**\n\nLet's count only those claims that are directly supported or have a clear equivalent in the reference model.\n\n- 6. 'VehicleA' part: **Supported** (as 'Vehicle')\n- 7. 'mass' attribute: **Supported** (type mismatch, but concept matches)\n- 12. 'Road' part: **Supported**\n- 14.

'vehicle_ID1_t0' exhibits state 'vehicleStates.on': **Supported** (as 'vehicleState: VehicleState')\n- 47. 'context_t0' contains snapshot 'road_ID1_t0': **Supported** (as 'road: Road')\n- 48. 'road_ID1_t0' has 'angle' set: **Supported** (as 'slope: Angle')\n- 49. 'road_ID1_t0' has 'surfaceFriction' set: **Supported** (as 'frictionCoefficient')\n- 53-56. 'vehicle_ID1_t1' has 'mass', 'position', 'velocity', 'acceleration' set: **Supported** (same as above)\n- 57. 'vehicle_ID1_t1' exhibits state 'vehicleStates.on': **Supported**\n- 59-60. 'road_ID1_t1' has 'angle', 'surfaceFriction' set: **Supported**\n- 64-67. 'vehicle_ID1_tn' has 'mass', 'position', 'velocity', 'acceleration' set: **Supported**\n- 68. 'vehicle_ID1_tn' exhibits state 'vehicleStates.off': **Supported**\n- 70-71. 'road_ID1_tn' has 'angle', 'surfaceFriction' set: **Supported**\n\nLet's count these:\n\n- 6, 7, 12, 14, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71\n\nThat's **26** supported claims.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Score: 26/71**",

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's go through each claim:\n\n### Parts and Inheritance\n\n1. **abstract part def Subsystem**  \n   - **Not covered**. The generated model has `abstract part def SubsystemA` and `SubsystemB`, but not a base `Subsystem`.\n\n2. **SubsystemA inherits from Subsystem**  \n   - **Not covered**. No inheritance from a base `Subsystem` in the generated model.\n\n3. **SubsystemA contains part1: Part1, part2: Part2, part3: Part3**  \n   - **Partially covered**. In the generated model, `SubsystemA` is abstract and contains `part3[0..1]` (via `abstract part :>> part3[0..1]`), but the actual composition of `part1`, `part2`, `part3` is only realized in the variants under `anyVehicleConfig`. So, the structure is present, but not as a direct definition.  \n   - **Let's count as covered** (since the structure is present via variants).\n\n4. **SubsystemB inherits from Subsystem**  \n   - **Not covered**. No inheritance from a base `Subsystem`.\n\n5. **SubsystemB contains part4: Part4, part5: Part5, part6: Part6**  \n   - **Partially covered**. In the generated model, `SubsystemB` is abstract and contains `part5[1]`, and in the variants, `part4`, `part5`, `part6` are present in different combinations.  \n   - **Let's count as covered** (since the structure is present via variants).\n\n6. **Part1 definition**  \n   - **Covered** (`part part1;`).\n\n7. **Part2 definition**  \n   - **Covered** (`part part2;`).\n\n8. **Part3 definition**  \n   - **Covered** (`part part3 { ... }`).\n\n9. **Part3 has port p1 : ~Transmission**  \n   - **Partially covered**. `part3` has `port p1;` in the generated model, but the type `~Transmission` is not specified.  \n   - **Not covered** (since the port type is missing).\n\n10. **Part4 definition**  \n    - **Covered** (`part part4;`).\n\n11. **Part5 definition**  \n    - **Covered** (`part part5 { ... }`).\n\n12. **Part5 has port p2 : ~Transmission**  \n    - **Partially covered**. `part5` has `port p2;`, but the type is not specified.  \n    - **Not covered** (since the port type is missing).\n\n13. **Part5 has variant behVariant1 : Part5Behavior1**  \n    - **Partially covered**. The generated model has a variation `perform action doXorY` with variants `doX` and `doY`, which correspond to behaviors, but the names and types do not match.  \n    - **Not covered** (since the variant names/types do not match).\n\n14. **Part5 has variant behVariant2 : Part5Behavior2**  \n    - **Same as above**. **Not covered**.\n\n15. **Part6 definition**  \n    - **Covered** (`part part6;`).\n\n### Requirements\n\n16. **abstract requirement def SubsystemConstraint**  \n    - **Not covered**.

No explicit configuration abstraction.\n\n23. **configuration def VehicleConfigA : VehicleConfiguration**  \n    - **Partially covered**. There is `part vehicleConfigA :> anyVehicleConfig`, which is a configuration, but not typed as `VehicleConfiguration`.  \n    - **Let's count as covered** (structure is present).\n\n24. **VehicleConfigA contains part subsystemA : SubsystemA**  \n    - **Covered** (via `part :>> subsystemA = subsystemA.subsystem1;`).\n\n25. **VehicleConfigA contains part subsystemB : SubsystemB**  \n    - **Covered** (via `part :>> subsystemB = subsystemB.subsystem3;`).\n\n26. **VehicleConfigA contains connector c1 : AssemblyConnector**  \n    - **Not covered**. No explicit connector definition.\n\n27. **VehicleConfigA binds subsystemA.part3.p1 -> c1 -> subsystemB.part5.p2**  \n    - **Partially covered**. There is `connect subsystemA.part3.p1[0..1] to subsystemB.part5.p2[1];` in `anyVehicleConfig`, which is inherited by `vehicleConfigA`. No explicit connector, but the connection is present.  \n    - **Let's count as covered**.\n\n28. **VehicleConfigA constrains VehicleConfigAConstraint**  \n    - **Partially covered**. There is an `assert constraint` in `anyVehicleConfig`, but it is not the same as `VehicleConfigAConstraint`.  \n    - **Not covered**.\n\n29. **configuration def VehicleConfigB : VehicleConfiguration**  \n    - **Covered** (`part VehicleConfigB :> anyVehicleConfig`).\n\n30. **VehicleConfigB contains part subsystemA : SubsystemA**  \n    - **Covered** (`part :>> subsystemA = subsystemA.subsystem2;`).\n\n31. **VehicleConfigB contains part subsystemB : SubsystemB**  \n    - **Covered** (`part :>> subsystemB = subsystemB.subsystem4;`).\n\n32. **VehicleConfigB.subsystemB has property part4Quant : Integer = 2**  \n    - **Not covered**. No such property in the generated model.\n\n33. **VehicleConfigB.subsystemB contains part part4 : Part4 [part4Quant]**  \n    - **Not covered**. No such multiplicity or property.\n\n34. **VehicleConfigB contains connector c2 : AssemblyConnector**  \n    - **Not covered**.\n\n35. **VehicleConfigB binds subsystemA.part2 -> c2 -> subsystemB.part4**  \n    - **Not covered**. No such connection.\n\n36. **VehicleConfigB constrains VehicleConfigBConstraint**  \n    - **Not covered**.\n\n### Actions\n\n37. **abstract action def Part5Behavior**  \n    - **Not covered**. No abstract action.\n\n38. **action def Part5Behavior1 : Part5Behavior**  \n    - **Partially covered**. There is `action doX;`, but no inheritance or typing.  \n    - **Not covered**.\n\n39. **action def Part5Behavior2 : Part5Behavior**  \n    - **Same as above**. **Not covered**.\n\n### Connectors\n\n40. **connector def Transmission**  \n    - **Not covered**.\n\n41. **connector def AssemblyConnector : Transmission**  \n    - **Not covered**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Definition of analysis `DynamicsAnalysis`.\n14. `DynamicsAnalysis` has subject `vehicle` of type `Vehicle`.\n15. `DynamicsAnalysis` has input attribute `powerProfile` of type ISQ::power[*] (sequence).\n16. `DynamicsAnalysis` has input attribute `initialPosition` of type ISQ::length.\n17. `DynamicsAnalysis` has input attribute `initialSpeed` of type ISQ::speed.\n18. `DynamicsAnalysis` has input attribute `deltaT` of type ISQ::time.\n19. `DynamicsAnalysis` returns attribute `accelerationProfile` of type ISQ::acceleration[*] (sequence).\n20. `DynamicsAnalysis` has private attribute `position` initialized to `initialPosition`.\n21. `DynamicsAnalysis` has private attribute `speed` initialized to `initialSpeed`.\n22. `DynamicsAnalysis` iterates over the powerProfile sequence (for i in 1..powerProfile->size()-1).\n23. In each iteration, it performs action `dynamics` as `StraightLineDynamics` with appropriate inputs.\n24. After action, assigns `position := dynamics.x_out`.\n25. After action, assigns `speed := dynamics.v_out`.\n26. After action, appends `dynamics.a_out` to `accelerationProfile`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.**\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n### 1. Package and Import Structure\n\n1. **Packages**: The reference model uses packages, but the specific package names differ. The structure (Vehicle, Dynamics, Analysis) is present in the reference as Simulator (with subparts), so this is **supported**.\n2. **Import ISQ**: The reference model does not specify units, but it is implied (attributes like mass: Real). Using ISQ is a refinement, but not a contradiction. **Supported**.\n3. **Other imports**: Not specified in the reference, but these are implementation details for sequence handling, not core modeling claims. **Supported** (neutral).\n\n### 2. Vehicle Model\n\n4. **Vehicle part**: The reference model has `Simulator.InputProcessor` with mass, initialPosition, initialVelocity, powerProfile. The generated model has a `Vehicle` part with only `mass`. The concept of a vehicle is present, but the attributes are distributed differently. The existence of a `Vehicle` part is **supported**.\n5. **Vehicle.mass**: The reference model has `mass` as an attribute of `InputProcessor`, not a `Vehicle` part, but the semantic is the same. **Supported**.\n\n### 3. Dynamics Model\n\n6. **Acceleration calculation**: The reference model describes calculation of acceleration from power, mass, and velocity in the documentation, but does not provide the formula. The generated model makes this explicit. The calculation is implied. **Supported**.\n7. **Velocity calculation**: Similarly, the reference model describes calculation of velocity from previous velocity, acceleration, and time step. **Supported**.\n8. **Position calculation**: Same as above. **Supported**.\n9. **StraightLineDynamics action**: The reference model has `Simulator.DynamicsCalculator` with an action `runSimulation(timeStep, endTime)` that iteratively calculates acceleration, velocity, and position. The generated model's `StraightLineDynamics` is a single-step calculation, which is a decomposition of the iterative process. **Supported**.\n10. **x_out = Position(x_in, v_in, delta_t)**: This is the calculation of new position, as in the reference. **Supported**.\n11. **v_out = Velocity(v_in, a_out, delta_t)**: Calculation of new velocity. **Supported**.\n12. **a_out = Acceleration(power, mass, v_in)**: Calculation of acceleration. **Supported**.\n\n### 4. Analysis Model\n\n13. **DynamicsAnalysis definition**: The reference model has no explicit \"analysis\" part, but the overall simulation is an analysis. **Supported**.\n14. **subject vehicle: Vehicle**: The reference model has a user providing inputs, and a simulator using them. The concept of a vehicle is present. **Supported**.\n15. **powerProfile input**: The reference model has `powerProfile: Sequence<Real>`. **Supported**.\n16. **initialPosition input**: The reference model has `initialPosition: Real`. **Supported**.\n17. **initialSpeed input**: The reference model has `initialVelocity: Real`. The name differs, but the meaning is the same. **Supported**.\n18. **deltaT input**: The reference model has `timeStep: Duration` in `runSimulation`. **Supported**.\n19. **accelerationProfile output**: The reference model outputs sequences of acceleration, velocity, and position. The generated model only outputs accelerationProfile. **Partially supported** (see note below).\n20. **private attribute position := initialPosition**: The reference model initializes position from input. **Supported**.\n21. **private attribute speed := initialSpeed**: The reference model initializes velocity from input. **Supported**.\n22. **Iteration over powerProfile**: The reference model describes iterative calculation over time steps. **Supported**.\n23. **Perform action dynamics: StraightLineDynamics**: The reference model's `runSimulation` performs calculations at each step. **Supported**.\n24. **Assign position := dynamics.x_out**: The reference model updates position at each step. **Supported**.\n25. **Assign speed := dynamics.v_out**: The reference model updates velocity at each step. **Supported**.\n26. **Append dynamics.a_out to accelerationProfile**: The reference model collects acceleration at each step. **Supported**.\n\n**Note on claim 19:**  \nThe generated model only outputs `accelerationProfile`, while the reference model outputs sequences of acceleration, velocity, and position. However, the generated model does compute and update position and speed internally, but does not output them. The claim is that it outputs accelerationProfile, which is supported by the reference model (though less than the reference). So, the claim is **supported**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nAll 26 atomic claims are supported by the reference model (with minor differences in structure or naming, but not in semantics).\n\n**Score: 26/26**",

There is a package named `VehicleSafetyAndAntiTheft`.\n2. Inside the package, there is a requirement catalogue named `VehicleSafetyAndAntiTheftFunctionCatalogue`.\n3. The catalogue has a documentation string describing its purpose.\n\n**Contained requirements:**\n4.

The atomic claims are about the requirements and their structure, not the parts themselves.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### 1. There is a package named `VehicleSafetyAndAntiTheft`.\n- **Generated model:** The top-level package is named `'VehicleSafetyandSecurityFeatureCatalog'`. The name is different, but the semantics are equivalent (vehicle safety and anti-theft/security feature catalog).\n- **Covered:** Yes.\n\n#### 2. Inside the package, there is a requirement catalogue named `VehicleSafetyAndAntiTheftFunctionCatalogue`.\n- **Generated model:** There is no explicit \"requirement catalogue\" element. The generated model organizes content via packages and parts, not requirements or requirement catalogues.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 3. The catalogue has a documentation string describing its purpose.\n- **Generated model:** No documentation string at the package or catalogue level.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 4. There is a requirement named `SafetyFeatures` with a documentation string.\n- **Generated model:** There is a package `'Safety Features'`, which groups parts with the `@Safety` annotation. This is a structural mapping of the concept, though not a requirement per se. The documentation string is not present.\n- **Covered:** Partially. The concept is mapped, but not as a requirement or with documentation. For recall, we require the element to exist, not necessarily as a requirement stereotype, so this is **covered**.\n\n#### 5. `SafetyFeatures` contains a requirement named `BasicSafetyComponents` with a documentation string.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit sub-requirement or documentation. The model does include parts like seat belts and bumpers, but not as a requirement element.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 6. `SafetyFeatures` contains a requirement named `OptionalSafetyComponents` with a documentation string.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit sub-requirement or documentation. The model does include optional safety components (driverAirBag, antilockBrakes) with `isMandatory = false`, but not as a requirement element.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 7. There is a requirement named `SecurityFeatures` with a documentation string.\n- **Generated model:** There is a package `'Security Features'`, which groups parts with the `@Security` annotation. This is a structural mapping of the concept, though not a requirement per se. The documentation string is not present.\n- **Covered:** Partially. The concept is mapped, but not as a requirement or with documentation. For recall, we require the element to exist, not necessarily as a requirement stereotype, so this is **covered**.\n\n#### 8. There is a requirement named `CatalogueDistinctions` with a documentation string.\n- **Generated model:** There is a package `'Safety & Security Features'` and a package `'Mandatory Safety Features'`, which correspond to the distinctions described in the documentation (safety, security, both, mandatory). However, there is no explicit requirement or documentation.\n- **Covered:** The structural distinction is present, but not as a requirement or with documentation.

It does not define FMEA concepts, situations, causes, effects, FMEA items, connections, metadata, or the detailed structure of the device.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n**A. Library Definitions (1-37):**  \nAll these define a generic FMEA framework (situations, causes, effects, FMEA items, connections, etc.).  \n**Supported?** No.  \n**Reason:** The reference model does not define or mention any of these FMEA concepts, types, or structures.\n\n**B. Metadata Definitions (38-66):**  \nAll these define metadata and enums for the FMEA framework.  \n**Supported?** No.  \n**Reason:** The reference model does not define or mention any metadata, enums, or similar constructs.\n\n**C. User Model (67-93):**  \nThese define requirements (req1, req2, req3), FMEA items, connections, and device structure.\n\n- 67-69: Definition of requirements req1, req2, req3.  \n  **Supported?** Partially. The reference model defines six requirements, but not with these names or structure. The generated requirements are not mapped to the reference requirements, and their content is not equivalent.\n\n- 70: req3 has @StatusHolder { status = Status::Approved; }  \n  **Supported?** No. The reference model mentions approval in a requirement, but not as a metadata attribute.\n\n- 71: req3 has doc \"Alarm when battery has sank\".  \n  **Supported?** Partially. The reference model has a requirement about battery depletion detection and alerting, but not with this exact text or structure.\n\n- 72: req3 :>> sil = SIL::A.  \n  **Supported?** No. The reference model does not mention SIL or safety integrity levels.\n\n- 73-81: Definition of FMEA item 'Glucose FMEA Item' and its internal structure (causes, effects, causations, etc.).  \n  **Supported?** Partially. The reference model mentions battery depletion, inability to charge, glucose measurement failure, and therapy delay in the requirements' documentation, but not as structured FMEA items or with explicit cause-effect chains.\n\n- 82-83: #violation and #mitigation connections.  \n  **Supported?** No. The reference model does not define these connections.\n\n- 84-93: Definition of FMEA item 'Glucose Meter in Use' and its internal structure (parts, events, etc.).  \n  **Supported?** Partially. The reference model refers to the blood glucose meter and battery, but does not define their structure or events.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The only partial overlap is in the *subject matter* (battery depletion, inability to charge, glucose measurement failure, therapy delay, and requirement approval), but the modeling elements and structure are not present in the reference model.\n- There are **no atomic claims in the generated model that are directly and unambiguously supported by the reference model** as minimal, meaningful modeling elements.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n**Score: 0/93**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nNone of the atomic modeling claims in the generated system model are directly supported by the reference model. The generated model introduces a comprehensive FMEA framework and device structure that are not present in the reference model, which is limited to high-level requirements and a satisfy relationship. While some subject matter overlaps (battery, glucose measurement, therapy delay), the modeling elements themselves do not match.",
