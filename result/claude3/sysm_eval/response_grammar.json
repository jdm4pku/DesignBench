Definition of part `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered**: Present in `Definitions` package.\n\n#### 2. `Vehicle` has attribute `mass` of type `Real` with default 1750.0.\n- **Partially Covered**: Attribute `mass` exists (type is `ISQ::mass`), but default value is not in the definition, rather in the instance `vehicle1`. However, in the generated model, `vehicle1` (usage) redefines `mass` with default 1750 [kg], which matches the intent.\n\n#### 3. `Vehicle` has part `frontAxle` of type `Axle` (multiplicity 1).\n- **Partially Covered**: In the generated model, `Vehicle` does not directly have `frontAxle`; instead, in the instance `vehicle1`, there is a `frontAxleAssembly` containing `frontAxle: Axle`. The structure is more elaborate, but the presence of a front axle is maintained.\n\n#### 4. `Vehicle` has part `rearAxle` of type `Axle` (multiplicity 1).\n- **Partially Covered**: Same as above, via `rearAxleAssembly` containing `rearAxle: Axle`.\n\n#### 5. Definition of part `Axle`.\n- **Covered**: Present.\n\n#### 6. `Axle` has attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Covered**: Present (type is `ISQ::mass`).\n\n#### 7. `Axle` has part `tires` of type `Tire` (multiplicity 2, ordered).\n- **Not Covered**: In the generated model, `Axle` does not have a `tires` part. Instead, `AxleAssembly` contains `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered` and `rearWheel: Wheel[2] ordered`. There is no direct equivalent of `tires` as a part of `Axle`.\n\n#### 8.

Definition of part `RearAxle` as a specialization (`:>`) of `Axle`.\n- **Not Covered**: There is no `RearAxle` part definition in the generated model.\n\n#### 11. Definition of part `Tire`.\n- **Not Covered**: There is no `Tire` part definition; instead, there is a `Wheel` part, but no mapping is given.\n\n#### 12. `Tire` has attribute `mass` of type `Real`.\n- **Not Covered**: As above, no `Tire` part, so no attribute.\n\n#### 13. Definition of part `vehicle1_c1` of type `Vehicle`.\n- **Covered**: Present as `vehicle1_c1 :> vehicle1`.\n\n#### 14. In `vehicle1_c1`, attribute `mass` is redefined to 2000.0.\n- **Covered**: Present.\n\n#### 15. In `vehicle1_c1`, part `frontAxle` is redefined to type `FrontAxle`.\n- **Partially Covered**: In the generated model, `frontAxle_c1: FrontAxle` redefines `frontAxle` within `frontAxleAssembly_c1`, which itself redefines `frontAxleAssembly`.

Definition of `VehicleDynamicsSimulationSystem` as a part.\n- **Generated model:** No explicit system part; the top-level structure is the package and the reference individual.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 23. `VehicleDynamicsSimulationSystem` has part `vehicle : Vehicle`.\n- **Generated model:** The reference individual contains vehicle instances, but not as a part of a system part.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 24. `VehicleDynamicsSimulationSystem` has part `road : Road`.\n- **Generated model:** As above.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 25. `VehicleDynamicsSimulationSystem` has part `timeSeries : SimulationTimeSeries`.\n- **Generated model:** As above.\n- **Covered:** No.\n\n#### 26.

The generated model uses a metadata annotation, which is a different mechanism, but the intent is equivalent. **Supported**.\n\n#### PartsTree\n3. **Definition of part `vehicle`.**  \n   - **Supported**: Reference model defines `Vehicle`.\n4. **`vehicle` contains part `interior`.**  \n   - **Supported**: Reference model: `Vehicle` has `interior : Interior`.\n5. **`interior` contains part `alarm` annotated with `@Security`.**  \n   - **Supported**: Reference model: `Interior` has `antiTheftAlarm : AntiTheftAlarm` with `securityCategory = \"Security\"`. The name differs, but the role matches. **Supported**.\n6. **`interior` contains part `seatBelt[2]` annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`.**  \n   - **Supported**: Reference model: `Interior` has `seatBelts : SeatBelt[2]` with `isMandatory = true`.\n7. **`interior` contains part `frontSeat[2]`.**  \n   - **Not Supported**: No `frontSeat` in reference model.\n8. **`interior` contains part `driverAirBag` annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`.**  \n   - **Supported**: Reference model: `Interior` has `airbag : Airbag[0..1]` with `isMandatory = false`. The name is more specific in the generated model, but the structure matches.\n9. **`vehicle` contains part `bodyAssy`.**  \n   - **Not Supported**: No `bodyAssy` in reference model. Reference model has `body : Body` in `Vehicle`.\n10. **`bodyAssy` contains part `body`.**  \n    - **Supported**: Reference model: `Vehicle` has `body : Body`. The generated model adds an extra container, but the part exists.\n11. **`bodyAssy` contains part `bumper` annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = true;}`.**  \n    - **Supported**: Reference model: `Body` has `bumper : Bumper` with `isMandatory = true`.\n12. **`bodyAssy` contains part `keylessEntry` annotated with `@Security`.**  \n    - **Supported**: Reference model: `Body` has `keylessEntrySystem : KeylessEntrySystem` with `securityCategory = \"Security\"`. Name differs, but role matches.\n13. **`vehicle` contains part `wheelAssy`.**  \n    - **Not Supported**: No `wheelAssy` in reference model. Reference model has `chassis : Chassis` in `Vehicle`.\n14. **`wheelAssy` contains part `wheel[2]`.**  \n    - **Supported**: Reference model: `Chassis` has `wheels : Wheel[2]`.\n15. **`wheelAssy` contains part `antilockBrakes[2]` annotated with `@Safety{isMandatory = false;}`.**  \n    - **Supported**: Reference model: `Chassis` has `antilockBrakingSystems : AntilockBrakingSystem[0..2]` with `isMandatory = false`. The multiplicity is different (2 vs 0..2), but 2 is within 0..2, so **Supported**.\n\n#### Feature Packages (imports)\n16. **Definition of package 'Safety Features' with import of all vehicle parts annotated with `@Safety`.**  \n    - **Supported**: Reference model distinguishes safety features via `safetyCategory` and `isMandatory` attributes. The generated model uses annotation, but the intent is equivalent.\n17. **Definition of package 'Security Features' with import of all vehicle parts annotated with `@Security`.**  \n    - **Supported**: As above, intent matches.\n18. **Definition of package 'Safety & Security Features' with import of all vehicle parts annotated with `@Safety or @Security`.**  \n    - **Supported**: As above, intent matches.\n19. **Definition of package 'Mandatory Saftey Features' with import of all vehicle parts annotated with `@Safety and Safety::isMandatory`.**  \n    - **Supported**: As above, intent matches.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\n**Supported claims:**  \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19  \n**Not supported:**  \n7, 9, 13\n\n**Score: 16/19**",

model does not define a \"system\" part, but the `AscentProfile` and related attributes serve a similar function for recording trajectory data.\n\n28. **TrajectoryRecordingSystem has attribute missionLiftoffTime : UTCTime:**  \n    **Covered.** `mets: MissionElapsedTimeScale` has `definitionalEpochInUTC`.\n\n29. **TrajectoryRecordingSystem has attribute trajectoryData :

For each atomic claim, determine coverage in the generated model\n\n**A.

Attributes**\n5. `fuelLevel : Real` in `FuelTankAssembly` — **Not covered**\n6. `fuelTemperature : Real` in `FuelTankAssembly` — **Not covered**\n7. `fuelConsumptionRate : Real` in `Engine` — **Not covered**\n\n**C. Ports**\n8. `fuelSupplyPort : FuelFlow` in `FuelTankAssembly` — **Partially covered** (has `fuelTankPort : FuelOutPort`, which provides a supply port, but not named the same and not explicitly typed as `FuelFlow`, but the structure is similar)\n9. `fuelReturnPort : ~FuelFlow` in `FuelTankAssembly` — **Partially covered** (see above)\n10. `fuelInletPort : ~FuelFlow` in `Engine` — **Partially covered** (`engineFuelPort : FuelInPort` with an `in item fuelSupply`)\n11. `fuelOutletPort : FuelFlow` in `Engine` — **Partially covered** (as above)\n12. `inPort : ~FuelFlow` in `FuelLine` — **Not covered** (no `FuelLine`)\n13. `outPort : FuelFlow` in `FuelLine` — **Not covered**\n\n**D. Interface Definition**\n14. `FuelFlow` interface — **Partially covered** (there is a `Fuel` type, but not explicitly an interface with attributes)\n15. `flowRate : Real` in `FuelFlow` — **Not covered**\n16. `temperature : Real` in `FuelFlow` — **Partially covered** (ports have `attribute temperature : Temp`, so temperature is modeled, but not as part of `FuelFlow`)\n\n**E. Vehicle Structure**\n17. `fuelTank : FuelTankAssembly` in `Vehicle` — **Partially covered** (`tankAssy : FuelTankAssembly` in `vehicle`)\n18. `engine : Engine` in `Vehicle` — **Partially covered** (`eng : Engine` in `vehicle`)\n19. `supplyLine : FuelLine` in `Vehicle` — **Not covered**\n20. `returnLine : FuelLine` in `Vehicle` — **Not covered**\n\n**F. Connections (Interfaces)**\n21. `fuelTank.fuelSupplyPort` to `supplyLine.inPort` — **Not covered** (no `supplyLine`)\n22. `supplyLine.outPort` to `engine.fuelInletPort` — **Not covered**\n23. `engine.fuelOutletPort` to `returnLine.inPort` — **Not covered**\n24. `returnLine.outPort` to `fuelTank.fuelReturnPort` — **Not covered**\n\nHowever, the generated model does have:\n- `flow of Fuel from tankAssy.fuelTankPort.fuelSupply to eng.engineFuelPort.fuelSupply;`\n- `flow of Fuel from eng.engineFuelPort.fuelReturn to tankAssy.fuelTankPort.fuelReturn;`\n\nThese two flows correspond to the overall supply and return paths, but they skip the intermediate `FuelLine` parts. So, they only partially cover the reference model's connections.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the **covered** claims (full or strong partial coverage):\n\n| # | Claim | Coverage |\n|---|-------|----------|\n| 1 | FuelTankAssembly part def | Covered |\n| 2 | Engine part def | Covered |\n| 3 | FuelLine part def | Not covered |\n| 4 | Vehicle part def | Covered |\n| 5 | fuelLevel attr | Not covered |\n| 6 | fuelTemperature attr | Not covered |\n| 7 | fuelConsumptionRate attr | Not covered |\n| 8 | fuelSupplyPort | Partially covered |\n| 9 | fuelReturnPort | Partially covered |\n|10 | fuelInletPort | Partially covered |\n|11 | fuelOutletPort | Partially covered |\n|12 | FuelLine inPort | Not covered |\n|13 | FuelLine outPort | Not covered |\n|14 | FuelFlow interface | Partially covered |\n|15 | flowRate attr | Not covered |\n|16 | temperature attr | Partially covered |\n|17 | fuelTank part in Vehicle | Partially covered |\n|18 | engine part in Vehicle | Partially covered |\n|19 | supplyLine part in Vehicle | Not covered |\n|20 | returnLine part in Vehicle | Not covered |\n|21 | fuelTank.fuelSupplyPort to supplyLine.inPort | Not covered |\n|22 | supplyLine.outPort to engine.fuelInletPort | Not covered |\n|23 | engine.fuelOutletPort to returnLine.inPort | Not covered |\n|24 | returnLine.outPort to fuelTank.fuelReturnPort | Not covered |\n\nLet's count as **covered** those that are fully or strongly partially covered (i.e., the main structure is present, even if names or types differ, but not if the element is missing or the structure is fundamentally different).\n\n- 1. FuelTankAssembly part def — Covered\n- 2. Engine part def — Covered\n- 4. Vehicle part def — Covered\n- 8. fuelSupplyPort — Partially covered (port exists, but not same name/type; let's count as covered)\n- 9. fuelReturnPort — Partially covered (as above)\n- 10. fuelInletPort — Partially covered (as above)\n- 11. fuelOutletPort — Partially covered (as above)\n- 14. FuelFlow interface — Partially covered (Fuel type used, but not as interface; let's not count)\n- 16. temperature attribute — Partially covered (temperature attribute present, but not in FuelFlow; let's count)\n- 17. fuelTank part in Vehicle — Partially covered (tankAssy)\n- 18. engine part in Vehicle — Partially covered (eng)\n- Flows: The two main flows are present, but the intermediate FuelLine parts are missing, so the connections are not covered.\n\nSo, the covered claims are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18 = **10**\n\n**Total claims:** 24\n\n---\n\n**Score: 10/24**"

This models the transition logic between \"charging\" and \"idle\" states, but does not explicitly model the states or the entry actions.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For recall, unless the type is present, this is **not fully covered**.\n- 26. State idle exists: **Covered**\n- 28. State idle transition to charging when batteryLevel < 100.0: **Covered**\n- 29. State charging exists: **Covered**\n- 31.

If we treat `Picture` as equivalent to `Photo`, this could be supported, but the names are different and there is no evidence of equivalence.\n\n**4. Definition of action `Focus` with input `scene : Scene` and output `image : Image`.**  \n- **Partially supported.** Reference model has `action autoFocus` (input: `scene : Scene`, output: `focusSettings : FocusSettings`) and `action captureImage` (input: `focus : FocusSettings`, output: `rawImage : Image`). The generated model's `Focus` action outputs an `Image` directly, which is not the same as the reference model's structure.  \n- **Not supported.**\n\n**5. Definition of action `Shoot` with input `image : Image` and output `picture : Picture`.**  \n- **Partially supported.** Reference model has `outputPhoto` (input: `image : Image`, output: `finalPhoto : Photo`). If `Picture` is considered equivalent to `Photo`, this would be supported.  \n- **Not supported** (since the model does not establish this equivalence).\n\n**6. Definition of action `TakePicture` with input `scene : Scene` and output `picture : Picture`.**  \n- **Not supported.** Reference model does not have a single action that takes a `Scene` and outputs a `Photo`/`Picture` directly; it is a sequence of actions.\n\n**7. Definition of action `takePicture` as an instance of `TakePicture` with input `scene` and output `picture`.**  \n- **Not supported.** See above.\n\n**8. Definition of subaction `focus` as an instance of `Focus` within `takePicture`, with input `scene = takePicture::scene` and output `image`.**  \n- **Not supported.** See claim 4.\n\n**9. Definition of flow from `focus.image` to `shoot.image` within `takePicture`.**  \n- **Not supported.** In the reference model, the flow is from `focusSettings` to `captureImage`, not from `Image` to `Image`.\n\n**10. Definition of subaction `shoot` as an instance of `Shoot` within `takePicture`, with output `picture = takePicture::picture`.**  \n- **Not supported.** See claim 5.\n\n**11. Definition of part `Camera`.**  \n- **Supported.** Reference model defines `part def Camera`.\n\n**12. Definition of part `AutoFocus`.**  \n- **Supported.** Reference model defines `part def FocusModule`, which is equivalent in function to `AutoFocus`.\n\n**13. Definition of part `Imager`.**  \n- **Supported.** Reference model defines `part def ImagingModule`, which is equivalent in function to `Imager`.\n\n**14. Definition of part `camera` as an instance of `Camera` with:**\n  - **14a. Performing action `takePhoto[*] ordered` referencing `takePicture`.**  \n    - **Not supported.** Reference model does not have a `takePhoto` action; the sequence is defined as `shootPhoto` with subactions.\n  - **14b. Definition of part `f` as an instance of `AutoFocus` within `camera`, performing `takePhoto.focus`.**  \n    - **Not supported.** Reference model has `focusModule` as a part, but the action structure is not the same.\n  - **14c. Definition of part `i` as an instance of `Imager` within `camera`, performing `takePhoto.shoot`.**  \n    - **Not supported.** Reference model has `imagingModule` as a part, but the action structure is not the same.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Then send `Show(shoot.picture)` to `screen`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.**\n\n1. **Definition of item `Scene`.**  \n   - **Supported.** Reference model defines `item def Scene;`\n\n2. **Definition of item `Image`.**  \n   - **Supported.** Reference model defines `item def Image;`\n\n3. **Definition of item `Picture`.**  \n   - **Not supported.** Reference model defines `Photo` (used as output of `Capture`), but not `Picture`. If we consider `Picture` as equivalent to `Photo`, then it is supported. For this evaluation, let's treat them as equivalent, since the role and structure match.\n   - **Supported (with equivalence to `Photo`).**\n\n4. **Definition of attribute `Show` with item `picture` of type `Picture`.**  \n   - **Partially supported.** Reference model defines `action def ShowPhoto { in photo : Photo; }`, which is an action, not an attribute. The generated model uses an attribute, but the intent (showing a photo/picture) is the same. For minimal modeling claims, the existence of a \"Show\" element with a picture/photo input is supported.\n   - **Supported (with structural difference).**\n\n5. **Definition of action `Focus` with input item `scene` of type `Scene` and output item `image` of type `Image`.**  \n   - **Supported.** Reference model defines `action def Focus { in scene : Scene; out image : Image; }`\n\n6. **Definition of action `Shoot` with input item `image` of type `Image` and output item `picture` of type `Picture`.**  \n   - **Supported (with equivalence to `Capture`).** Reference model defines `action def Capture { in image : Image; out photo : Photo; }`. The generated model uses `Shoot` and `Picture` instead of `Capture` and `Photo`, but the structure and semantics match.\n\n7. **Definition of action `TakePicture`.**  \n   - **Not supported.** There is no action named `TakePicture` in the reference model. However, the reference model has a composite action `shootAndDisplay` that combines focus, capture, and show. If `TakePicture` is meant to be a composite action, this is a structural difference, but the claim of defining such an action is not directly supported.\n   - **Not supported.**\n\n8. **Definition of action `screen`.**  \n   - **Not supported.** The reference model has a `Display` part, but not an action named `screen`. The generated model uses `screen` as an action, which does not directly correspond to any element in the reference model.\n   - **Not supported.**\n\n9. **Definition of action `takePicture` as an instance of `TakePicture` with the following structure:**\n   - 9a. **Sub-action `trigger` that accepts `scene` of type `Scene`.**  \n       - **Supported.** The reference model's `shootAndDisplay` action takes `scene` as input via `camera.sceneInput`, which is ultimately provided by the user. The explicit \"accept\" is not present, but the input is.\n       - **Supported.**\n   - 9b. **Then sub-action `focus` as an instance of `Focus` with input `scene = trigger.scene` and output `image`.**  \n       - **Supported.** Reference model's `shootAndDisplay` does this.\n   - 9c. **Flow from `focus.image` to `shoot.image`.**  \n       - **Supported.** Reference model's `shootAndDisplay` passes `focus.image` to `capture.image`.\n   - 9d. **Then sub-action `shoot` as an instance of `Shoot` with input `image` and output `picture`.**  \n       - **Supported (with equivalence to `Capture`).**\n   - 9e. **Then send `Show(shoot.picture)` to `screen`.**  \n       - **Partially supported.** Reference model's `shootAndDisplay` calls `ShowPhoto` with `photo = capture.photo` and binds `display.photoInput = capture.photo`. The generated model sends a `Show` message to `screen`. The intent is the same, though the mechanism differs.\n       - **Supported (with structural difference).**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the claims:\n\n- 1: Supported\n- 2: Supported\n- 3: Supported (with equivalence)\n- 4: Supported (with structural difference)\n- 5: Supported\n- 6: Supported (with equivalence)\n- 7: Not supported\n- 8: Not supported\n- 9a: Supported\n- 9b: Supported\n- 9c: Supported\n- 9d: Supported (with equivalence)\n- 9e: Supported (with structural difference)\n\n**Total claims:** 13  \n**Supported claims:** 11\n\n---\n\n**Score: 11/13**",

Definition of requirement `VehicleMassRequirement`.\n- **Covered**: The generated model has `MassLimitationRequirement` and `VehicleMassLimitationRequirement`, which are equivalent in intent.\n\n#### 2. `VehicleMassRequirement` has attribute `emptyMass : Real`.\n- **Partially Covered**: The generated model uses `dryMass` and `fuelMass` for the vehicle, and in the requirement, `massActual` is redefined as `vehicle.dryMass + vehicle.fuelMass`. There is no direct `emptyMass`, but `emptyVehicleMassLimit` sets `vehicle.fuelMass == 0`, so `dryMass` is equivalent to `emptyMass`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 3. `VehicleMassRequirement` has attribute `fullyFueledMass : Real`.\n- **Partially Covered**: `fuelFullMass` is present, and `fullVehicleMassLimit` sets `vehicle.fuelMass == vehicle.fuelFullMass`, so `dryMass + fuelFullMass` is equivalent to `fullyFueledMass`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 4. `VehicleMassRequirement` has constraint: `emptyMass <= 1500.0`.\n- **Covered**: `emptyVehicleMassLimit` sets `massReqd = 1500[kg]` and `vehicle.fuelMass == 0`, so `dryMass <= 1500`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 5. `VehicleMassRequirement` has constraint: `fullyFueledMass <= 2000.0`.\n- **Covered**: `fullVehicleMassLimit` sets `massReqd = 2000[kg]` and `vehicle.fuelMass == vehicle.fuelFullMass`, so `dryMass + fuelFullMass <= 2000`. **Covered**.\n\n#### 6.

Naming is different, but the structure is the same. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 2:** There is an action named 'computeDynamics'.  \n- **Supported?** The reference model has actions for simulation, specifically 'performSimulation', 'calculateDynamics', and 'executeCalculation'. 'computeDynamics' is equivalent in function to these. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 3:** The action 'computeDynamics' imports 'AnalysisTooling::*' privately.  \n- **Supported?** The reference model uses 'AnalysisToolInterface' and 'ModelCenterTool', which are analogous to importing analysis tooling. The import is an implementation detail, but the intent is present. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 4:** The action 'computeDynamics' has metadata 'ToolExecution' with toolName = \"ModelCenter\" and a URI.  \n- **Supported?** The reference model integrates with 'ModelCenterTool' and references an interface to an analysis tool. The metadata is a different way to express this, but the intent is present. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 5:** The action 'computeDynamics' has an input 'dt' of type 'ISQ::TimeValue', mapped to tool variable \"deltaT\".  \n- **Supported?** The reference model has 'timeStep : Real' as an attribute and as an input to actions. The type is more specific in the generated model, but the concept matches. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 6:** The action 'computeDynamics' has an input 'a' of type 'ISQ::AccelerationValue', mapped to tool variable \"mass\".  \n- **Supported?** The reference model has 'acceleration : Real' as an attribute and input. However, the mapping to tool variable \"mass\" is likely a mistake (should be \"acceleration\"), but the input itself is present. **Supported** for the presence of the input, but the mapping is not supported.\n\n**Claim 7:** The action 'computeDynamics' has an input 'v_in' of type 'ISQ::SpeedValue', mapped to tool variable \"v0\".  \n- **Supported?** The reference model has 'initialVelocity : Real' as an attribute and input. The mapping to \"v0\" is a naming difference. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 8:** The action 'computeDynamics' has an input 'x_in' of type 'ISQ::LengthValue', mapped to tool variable \"x0\".  \n- **Supported?** The reference model has 'initialPosition : Real' as an attribute and input. The mapping to \"x0\" is a naming difference. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 9:** The action 'computeDynamics' has an output 'v_out' of type 'ISQ::SpeedValue', mapped to tool variable \"v\".  \n- **Supported?** The reference model has 'finalVelocity : Real' as an attribute and output. The mapping to \"v\" is a naming difference. **Supported.**\n\n**Claim 10:** The action 'computeDynamics' has an output 'x_out' of type 'ISQ::LengthValue', mapped to tool variable \"x\".  \n- **Supported?** The reference model has 'finalPosition : Real' as an attribute and output. The mapping to \"x\" is a naming difference. **Supported.**\n\n---\n\n#### Special note on Claim 6:\n- The input 'a' is mapped to tool variable \"mass\", which is inconsistent (should be \"acceleration\").

These are not attributes of a part, but as action parameters.\n- The action is mapped to a tool execution (ModelCenter), which is similar to the reference's use of ModelCenterTool and AnalysisToolInterface, but not as explicit parts/ports.\n- There is no explicit structure for parts, ports, items, or requirements.\n\nSo, the only claims that are **fully covered** are:\n\n- There is an action for vehicle dynamics calculation with inputs: initial velocity, initial position, acceleration, time step.\n- The action produces outputs: final velocity, final position.\n\nLet's map the claims that are **covered**:\n\n2. `VehicleDynamicsSystem` has attribute `initialVelocity : Real`.  \n   **Covered as input `v_in` in action.**\n\n3. `VehicleDynamicsSystem` has attribute `initialPosition : Real`.  \n   **Covered as input `x_in` in action.**\n\n4. `VehicleDynamicsSystem` has attribute `acceleration : Real`.  \n   **Covered as input `a` in action.**\n\n5. `VehicleDynamicsSystem` has attribute `timeStep : Real`.  \n   **Covered as input `dt` in action.**\n\n6. `VehicleDynamicsSystem` has attribute `finalVelocity : Real`.  \n   **Covered as output `v_out` in action.**\n\n7. `VehicleDynamicsSystem` has attribute `finalPosition : Real`.  \n   **Covered as output `x_out` in action.**\n\n29. `ModelCenterTool` has action `calculateDynamics` with input `inputData : SimulationData`.  \n   **Covered as action `computeDynamics` with similar inputs.**\n\n30. `ModelCenterTool` has action `calculateDynamics` with output `outputData : SimulationData`.  \n   **Covered as action `computeDynamics` with similar outputs.**\n\n36. `performSimulation` subaction `receiveInput` with inputs.  \n   **Covered as action inputs.**\n\n37. `executeCalculation` with input/output.  \n   **Covered as action input/output.**\n\n42. Send parameters to `modelCenter.calculateDynamics`.  \n   **Covered as tool execution in action.**\n\n43. Assign results from tool output.  \n   **Covered as action outputs.**\n\n44. `outputResults` subaction with outputs.  \n   **Covered as action outputs.**\n\nSo, that's 13 claims.\n\nBut, since the generated model does not have the structure of parts, ports, items, or requirements, and only has a single action with inputs/outputs, only the claims directly corresponding to the action's inputs/outputs and its mapping to a tool execution are covered.\n\n**Let's be strict and only count the following as covered:**\n\n- 2. initialVelocity (input)\n- 3. initialPosition (input)\n- 4. acceleration (input)\n- 5. timeStep (input)\n- 6. finalVelocity (output)\n- 7. finalPosition (output)\n\n**Possibly also:**\n\n- 29. action with input\n- 30. action with output\n\nBut since the action is not part of a `ModelCenterTool`, and not named `calculateDynamics`, but the semantics are equivalent, we can count these.\n\nSo, **8 claims** are covered.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n#### A. Attribute and Type Definitions\n\n1. **MassValue :> ISQ::mass**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model uses `ISQ::mass` directly for the `mass` attribute, but does not define a `MassValue` type.\n\n2. **AngleValue :> ISQ::plane_angle**  \n   - **Not covered.** No such attribute type is defined; `steeringAngle` uses `ScalarValues::Real`.\n\n#### B. Part Definitions and Structure\n\n3. **part def Vehicle**  \n   - **Covered.** Present.\n\n4. **Vehicle has attribute mass : MassValue**  \n   - **Partially covered.** Attribute `mass` exists, but type is `ISQ::mass` (not `MassValue`). Acceptable as equivalent for recall.\n\n5. **Vehicle has part frontAxleAssembly : AxleAssembly**  \n   - **Covered.** Present in vehicle instances.\n\n6. **Vehicle has part rearAxleAssembly : AxleAssembly**  \n   - **Covered.** Present in vehicle instances.\n\n7. **part def AxleAssembly**  \n   - **Covered.** Present.\n\n8. **AxleAssembly has part axle : Axle**  \n   - **Not covered.** In the generated model, `AxleAssembly` is defined but has no internal structure; the structure is only present in the usages/instances.\n\n9. **AxleAssembly has part wheel1 : Wheel**  \n   - **Not covered.** Same as above.\n\n10. **AxleAssembly has part wheel2 : Wheel**  \n    - **Not covered.** Same as above.\n\n11. **part def Axle**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n12. **part def SteerableAxle :> Axle**  \n    - **Partially covered.** There is `FrontAxle :> Axle`, which is used as a steerable axle. Acceptable as equivalent.\n\n13. **SteerableAxle has attribute steeringAngle : AngleValue**  \n    - **Partially covered.** `FrontAxle` has `steeringAngle: ScalarValues::Real`. Type is not the same, but the attribute is present.\n\n14. **part def Wheel**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n#### C. Part Instances and Structure\n\n15. **part vehicle1 : Vehicle**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n16. **vehicle1 has attribute mass = 1750 [kg]**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n17. **part vehicle2 : Vehicle**  \n    - **Covered.** Present as `vehicle1_c1`.\n\n18. **vehicle2 has attribute mass = 2000 [kg]**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n19. **vehicle2 has part frontAxleAssembly**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n20. **vehicle2.frontAxleAssembly has part axle : SteerableAxle**  \n    - **Partially covered.** In the generated model, `frontAxle` is of type `FrontAxle` (which is a specialization of `Axle` with `steeringAngle`). Acceptable as equivalent.\n\n21. **vehicle2.frontAxleAssembly has part leftWheel : wheel1**  \n    - **Partially covered.** The generated model uses `frontWheel[2]` and then defines `frontWheel_1` and `frontWheel_2` as subsets. This is a different structure, but the intent (two wheels, individually addressable) is preserved.\n\n22. **vehicle2.frontAxleAssembly has part rightWheel : wheel2**  \n    - **Partially covered.** As above.\n\n23. **vehicle2 has part rearAxleAssembly**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n24. **vehicle2.rearAxleAssembly has part leftWheel : wheel1**  \n    - **Partially covered.** As above, with `rearWheel[2]` and subsets.\n\n25. **vehicle2.rearAxleAssembly has part rightWheel : wheel2**  \n    - **Partially covered.** As above.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
