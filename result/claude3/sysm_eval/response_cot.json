So, **Yes**. |\n| 2 | There is a private import of ScalarValues::Real. | **No** | Not present in the reference model. |\n| 3 | There is an enumeration definition named TrafficLightColor. | **Yes** | Present in reference model. |\n| 4 | TrafficLightColor has an enum literal 'green'. | **Yes** | Present in reference model. |\n| 5 | TrafficLightColor has an enum literal 'yellow'. | **Yes** | Present in reference model. |\n| 6 | TrafficLightColor has an enum literal 'red'. | **Yes** | Present in reference model. |\n| 7 | There is a part definition named TrafficLight. | **Yes** | Equivalent to 'TrafficSignal' in reference model. Naming difference is ignored. |\n| 8 | TrafficLight has an attribute 'currentColor' of type TrafficLightColor. | **Yes** | Present in reference model. |\n| 9 | There is a part definition named TrafficLightGo that specializes TrafficLight. | **Yes** | Equivalent to 'greenSignal : TrafficSignal' in reference model, which is a specific instance/usage of TrafficSignal always in green state. The generated model uses specialization, which is a valid modeling approach. |\n| 10 | TrafficLightGo redefines the attribute 'currentColor' to be TrafficLightColor::green. | **Yes** | Present in reference model as 'attribute redefines currentColor = TrafficLightColor::green;' in the greenSignal part. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Instead, in the usage, `frontAxleAssembly` and `rearAxleAssembly` have `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered` and `rearWheel: Wheel[2] ordered`. The type is `Wheel` instead of `Tire`, and the containment is at the assembly level, not the axle. **Partial**: The concept of two wheels/tires per axle is present, but the structure and type differ. **Not strictly covered**.\n\n9. **Part def FrontAxle :> Axle**: Present.\n10. **FrontAxle.steeringAngle : Real [deg]**: Present (as `ScalarValues::Real`).\n11. **Part def RearAxle :> Axle**: Not present as a separate definition; only `Axle` is used for rear axle. **Not covered**.\n\n12. **Part def Tire**: Not present; instead, `Wheel` is defined. **Not covered**.\n13. **Tire.mass : Real [kg]**: Not present; `Wheel` does not have a `mass` attribute. **Not covered**.\n\n**C.

No explicit alias, but the concept of torque as a type is present.  \n   - **Supported (semantically equivalent).**\n\n2. **Attribute definition `FuelCmd`.**  \n   - Reference: `fuelCommand: Real` attribute in `PowertrainController`, and `fuelCommand: Real` in interfaces.  \n   - **Supported.**\n\n3. **Attribute definition `EngineStart`.**  \n   - Reference: `engineStartSignal: Boolean` in `PowertrainController`, and `startSignal: Boolean` in `EngineControlInterface`.  \n   - **Supported.**\n\n4. **Attribute definition `EngineOff`.**  \n   - Reference: `engineShutdownSignal: Boolean` in `PowertrainController`, and `shutdownSignal: Boolean` in `EngineControlInterface`.  \n   - **Supported.**\n\n5. **Action definition `'Generate Torque'` (in: fuelCmd, out: engineTorque).**  \n   - Reference: `action generateTorque { in fuelCmd: Real; out torque: Real; }` in `Engine`.  \n   - **Supported.**\n\n6. **Action definition `'Amplify Torque'` (in: engineTorque, out: transmissionTorque).**  \n   - Reference: `action amplifyTorque { in inputTorque: Real; in ratio: Real; out outputTorque: Real; }` in `Transmission`.  \n   - The generated model omits the `ratio` input, but the main function (amplifying torque) is present.  \n   - **Supported (core function matches, though less detailed).**\n\n7. **Action definition `'Transfer Torque'` (in: transmissionTorque, out: driveshaftTorque).**  \n   - Reference: Transmission's `torqueOutput` connects to `TorqueDistributor`'s `torqueInput`. No explicit action, but the transfer is modeled structurally.  \n   - **Supported (structural transfer is present).**\n\n8. **Action definition `'Distribute Torque'` (in: driveShaftTorque, out: wheelTorque1, wheelTorque2).**  \n   - Reference: `action distributeTorque { in totalTorque: Real; out wheelTorques: Real[4]; }` in `TorqueDistributor`.  \n   - The generated model only has two outputs, not four.  \n   - **Partially supported (the function is present, but the arity is reduced). For this scoring, we will count as supported, since the function is present, but note the loss of detail.**\n\n9. **Action definition `'Provide Power'` (in: fuelCmd, out: wheelTorque1, wheelTorque2).**  \n   - Reference: The overall system provides power from fuel command to wheels, but there is no single action named \"Provide Power\". The reference model achieves this via composition of actions and state machine.  \n   - **Supported (as a composition of actions, though not as a single action).**\n\n10. **Action usage `'provide power'` of `'Provide Power'` (with in/out).**  \n    - Reference: The system as a whole provides this function.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n11. **'provide power' action contains a loop structure.**  \n    - Reference: The state machine in `vehiclePowertrain` models repeated operation while running.  \n    - **Supported (semantically equivalent).**\n\n12. **Within the loop, acceptance of `engineStart: EngineStart`.**  \n    - Reference: State machine transition from `off` to `running` is guarded by `engineStartSignal`.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n13. **Action `'generate torque'` of `'Generate Torque'` (with in/out).**  \n    - Reference: `engine.generateTorque(vehiclePowertrain.fuelCommand) >> engine.outputTorque;` in state machine.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n14. **Flow from `'generate torque'.engineTorque` to `'amplify torque'.engineTorque`.**  \n    - Reference: `engine.outputTorque` is input to `transmission.amplifyTorque`.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n15. **Action `'amplify torque'` of `'Amplify Torque'` (with in/out).**  \n    - Reference: `transmission.amplifyTorque(engine.outputTorque, transmission.gearRatio) >> transmission.amplifiedTorque;`  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n16. **Flow from `'amplify torque'.transmissionTorque` to `'transfer torque'.transmissionTorque`.**  \n    - Reference: `transmission.torqueOutput` connects to `torqueDistributor.torqueInput`.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n17. **Action `'transfer torque'` of `'Transfer Torque'` (with in/out).**  \n    - Reference: No explicit action, but the transfer is modeled via port connections.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n18. **Flow from `'transfer torque'.driveshaftTorque` to `'distribute torque'.driveshaftTorque`.**  \n    - Reference: `transmission.torqueOutput` to `torqueDistributor.torqueInput`.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n19. **Action `'distribute torque'` of `'Distribute Torque'` (with in/out).**  \n    - Reference: `torqueDistributor.distributeTorque(transmission.amplifiedTorque) >> torqueDistributor.distributedTorque;`  \n    - **Supported (though only two wheels in generated model, four in reference).**\n\n20. **After the actions, acceptance of `engineOff: EngineOff`.**  \n    - Reference: State machine transition from `running` to `off` is guarded by `engineShutdownSignal`.  \n    - **Supported.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nAll 20 atomic claims are supported by the reference model, though some are less detailed (e.g., only two wheels instead of four, and some actions are more abstracted).\n\n**Score: 20/20**",

If `Temp` is equivalent to `Real`, this could be considered covered, but since `Temp` is only defined as an attribute, not a type, and not mapped to `Real`, **Not covered.**\n13. **`FuelFlowPort` has attribute `pressure: Real`.**  \n    - **Not covered.**\n14. **Interface definition `FuelFlowInterface`.**  \n    - **Covered.** As `FuelInterface`.\n15. **`FuelFlowInterface` has end `supplierPort: FuelFlowPort`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** `FuelInterface` has `supplierPort: FuelOutPort`, which is not the same type.\n16. **`FuelFlowInterface` has end `consumerPort: FuelFlowPort`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** `FuelInterface` has `consumerPort: FuelInPort`.\n17. **Part definition `VehicleFuelSystem`.**  \n    - **Partially covered.** There is a part `Vehicle`, but not `VehicleFuelSystem`.

The port types and names differ, but the structure is similar.\n21. **`VehicleFuelSystem` has interface `fuelReturnInterface: FuelFlowInterface` connecting `supplierPort` to `engine.fuelReturnPort` and `consumerPort` to `fuelTank.fuelReturnPort`.**  \n    - **Not covered.** No such interface in generated model.\n22. **Requirement `fuelCirculation` with constraint `fuelSupplyInterface.supplierPort.flowRate > 0`.**  \n    - **Not covered.** No requirements in generated model.\n23. **Requirement `temperatureMonitoring` with constraint on temperature.**  \n    - **Not covered.**\n24. **Requirement `systemReliability` with attribute `reliabilityTarget: Real = 0.999`.**  \n    - **Not covered.**\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the number of claims that are covered (fully or with strong equivalence):\n\n- 3. Part definition `FuelTankAssembly` (**covered**)\n- 7. Part definition `Engine` (**covered**)\n- 14.

Part definition `VehicleFuelSystem` (**partially covered**)\n\nIf we count only fully covered claims, the score is **3/24**.\n\nIf we count partial matches as covered (since the structure and semantics are similar, despite naming/type differences), then claims 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 could be considered covered, bringing the total to **9/24**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Score: 3/24** (strict, only fully covered claims)\n\n**If partial matches are accepted:**  \n**Score: 9/24** (including partial structural matches)\n\n**Defaulting to strict interpretation as per instructions:**\n\n---\n**Score: 3/24**"

The generated model's `Vehicle.mass` is of type `ISQ::mass`. If we accept that `MassValue` is an alias or type from `ISQ::mass`, this is **supported**.\n\n#### Package: DynamicsModel\n6. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not have a subpackage `DynamicsModel`.\n7. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not define a calculation named `Acceleration` as a separate element.\n8. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action uses `powerData : PowerSegment[*]`, `vehicleMass : MassValue`, and `initVel : SpeedValue` as inputs, which correspond to `p`, `m`, and `v` in the generated model.\n9. **Supported**: The formula `p / (m * v)` is described in the reference model's requirement: \"System shall compute acceleration at each time step using F = P/v and a = F/m\". The generated model combines these into a single formula, which is mathematically equivalent.\n10. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not define a calculation named `Velocity` as a separate element.\n11. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action uses `initVel` and outputs `velocitySequence`, and the requirement says \"integrate acceleration to obtain velocity sequence\", which matches the inputs.\n12. **Supported**: The formula `v0 + a * dt` is the standard Euler integration step, which is implied by the reference model's requirements.\n13. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not define a calculation named `Position` as a separate element.\n14. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action uses `initPos` and outputs `positionSequence`, and the requirement says \"integrate velocity to obtain position sequence\", which matches the inputs.\n15. **Supported**: The formula `x0 + v * dt` is the standard Euler integration step, which is implied by the reference model's requirements.\n16. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not define an action named `StraightLineDynamics`.\n17. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action takes similar inputs: power, mass, time step, position, velocity.\n18. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action outputs position, velocity, acceleration sequences.\n19. **Supported**: The output `x_out` as `Position(x_in, v_in, delta_t)` matches the reference model's approach.\n20. **Supported**: The output `v_out` as `Velocity(v_in, a_out, delta_t)` matches the reference model's approach.\n21. **Supported**: The output `a_out` as `Acceleration(power, mass, v_in)` matches the reference model's approach.\n\n#### Package: AnalysisModel\n22. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not have a subpackage `AnalysisModel`.\n23. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not have a `VehicleModel` subpackage to import.\n24. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not have a `DynamicsModel` subpackage to import.\n25. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not have a `SampledFunctions` package.\n26. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not have a `ScalarValues::Natural` import.\n27. **Not directly supported**: The reference model does not have a `SequenceFunctions` package.\n28. **Supported**: The reference model defines an analysis `LongitudinalDynamicsAnalysis`, which is equivalent to `DynamicsAnalysis`.\n29. **Supported (with mapping)**: The reference model's analysis has subject `system : VehicleDynamicsSystem`; the generated model uses `vehicle : Vehicle`. If we accept `Vehicle` as equivalent to `VehicleDynamicsSystem`, this is **supported**.\n30. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action takes `powerData : PowerSegment[*]` as input; the generated model uses `powerProfile : ISQ::power[*]`. If we accept that `PowerSegment` contains `power : PowerValue`, this is **supported**.\n31. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action takes `initPos : LengthValue`; the generated model uses `initialPosition : ISQ::length`.\n32. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action takes `initVel : SpeedValue`; the generated model uses `initialSpeed : ISQ::speed`.\n33. **Supported**: The reference model's `simulateDynamics` action takes `dt : TimeValue`; the generated model uses `deltaT : ISQ::time`.\n34. **Supported**: The reference model's analysis returns `accelerationProfile : AccelerationValue[*]`; the generated model returns `accelerationProfile : ISQ::acceleration[*]`.\n35. **Supported**: The generated model's `position` is initialized to `initialPosition`, which matches the reference model's approach.\n36. **Supported**: The generated model's `speed` is initialized to `initialSpeed`, which matches the reference model's approach.\n37. **Supported**: The generated model iterates over the power profile, which matches the reference model's handling of segmented power input.\n38. **Supported**: The generated model performs the dynamics calculation for each segment, matching the reference model's approach.\n39. **Supported**: The generated model updates `position` after each step, matching the reference model's approach.\n40. **Supported**: The generated model updates `speed` after each step, matching the reference model's approach.\n41. **Supported**: The generated model appends the new acceleration to the profile, matching the reference model's approach.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

It does not define FMEA structures, situations, causes, effects, or the FMEA-specific metadata and connections.\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### FMEALibrary (Claims 1–37)\n- All these claims define a generic FMEA modeling framework (situations, causes, effects, failure modes, FMEA items, connections, etc.).\n- **Not supported** by the reference model, which does not define these abstractions.\n\n#### FMEAMetadata (Claims 38–66)\n- All these claims define metadata and enums for FMEA modeling.\n- **Not supported** by the reference model.\n\n#### FMEAUserModel (Claims 67–93)\n- These claims instantiate the FMEA framework for a glucose meter scenario, with requirements, FMEA items, events, parts, and connections.\n- The only possible overlap is in the *intent* of some requirements and events (e.g., \"battery depleted\", \"battery cannot be charged\", \"glucose level undetected\", \"therapy delay\"), which correspond to the reference model's requirements for battery monitoring, alerting, and risk management.\n- However, the reference model does **not** define these as model elements (parts, events, FMEA items, or connections), but only as requirements and sub-requirements.\n- The generated model's requirements (`req1`, `req2`, `req3`) are generic and not mapped to the reference model's requirements (e.g., `BatteryMonitoringRequirement`, `AlarmMechanismRequirement`, etc.).\n- The only possible partial match is the documentation string for `req3` (\"Alarm when battery has sank\"), which is similar in intent to the reference model's requirement to alert the user when the battery is depleted. However, since the reference model does not define a requirement named `req3` or a `RequirementWithSIL` with a `sil` attribute, this is **not structurally supported**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**None** of the atomic claims in the generated model are directly supported by the reference model. The reference model is a requirements breakdown, while the generated model is an FMEA framework and instance.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\n**Score: 0/93**",

Package and Imports**\n1. **Package**: Yes, the generated model is in a package (`KinematicMotionSimulation`).\n2. **Imports**: Partial. The generated model imports `SequenceFunctions::*` and uses `ISQ::*` types, but does not explicitly import all the same packages. However, the necessary types are present.\n\n**B. Item Definitions (Data Types)**\n3. **PowerProfile**: **Partial**. The generated model uses `powerProfile : ISQ::power[*]` as an input, but does not define a `PowerProfile` item with both time and power arrays.

The generated model outputs `positions : ISQ::length[*]`, but does not define a `TrajectoryData` item or include time points.\n\n**C. Part Definitions**\n5. **Vehicle part**: **Not covered**.

No explicit controller part or its attributes/ports.\n7. **VehicleMotionSimulator part**: **Not covered**. No explicit simulator part with vehicle and controller as parts, or initial position/velocity as attributes.\n\n**D. Actions and Behavior**\n8. **simulate action**: **Covered**. The generated model's `ComputeMotion` action takes similar inputs (powerProfile, vehicleMass, initialPosition, initialSpeed, deltaT) and outputs positions. The binding of inputs to variables is present.\n9. **stepCalculation action**: **Covered**. The generated model defines `StraightLineDynamics` action, which is called in a loop in `ComputeMotion`. The calculation steps (force, acceleration, velocity, position) are implied by the input/output signature, though the exact formulas are not shown, but the structure matches.\n\n**E. Constraints**\n10. **oneDimensionalMotion constraint**: **Implicitly covered**. The generated model only models 1D motion (position, speed, power in 1D), so the constraint is satisfied by design.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Summarize the results\n\nLet's count the covered claims:\n\n- **Imports**: 1/4 (only partial import of ScalarValues, but not all; let's be strict and say 1/4)\n- **Part Definition**: 1/1\n- **Attributes**: 1/1\n- **Ports**: 3/3\n- **State Machine**: 4/4 (counting `responding` as equivalent to `response`)\n- **Transitions**: 5/5 (partial for `startup`, but the entry/then off is present)\n- **Usage**: 0/2\n\nBut for recall, we should only count as covered if the claim is present or equivalent. Partial coverage (like imports) is not enough unless the element is used equivalently.\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\n\n- **Imports**: None are fully covered (since the generated model does not import all, and the model works without explicit imports). For recall, we can ignore imports if the types are used correctly.\n- **Part Definition**: Covered\n- **Attributes**: Covered\n- **Ports**: Covered\n- **State Machine**: Covered\n- **Transitions**: Covered\n- **Usage**: Not covered\n\nSo, if we ignore imports (since they are not essential to the model's structure and semantics), we have:\n\nTotal claims (excluding imports): 16  \nCovered claims: 14\n\nIf we include imports:  \nTotal claims: 20  \nCovered claims: 14\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n**Score: 14/20**\n\n---\n\n**(If you wish to ignore imports as non-structural, the score would be 14/16.)**"

There is a calc def Velocity with inputs: dt (TimeValue), v0 (SpeedValue), a (AccelerationValue).\n11. Velocity returns SpeedValue = v0 + a * dt.\n\n12.

The generated model's Power function is a simplification and not physically correct (subtracts drag and friction from power, not force from force). **Not supported**\n5. **Power defines drag = Cd * v**: Reference model defines aerodynamicDrag = 0.5 * 1.225 * dragCoefficient * frontalArea * speed^2. The generated model's drag = Cd * v is a simplification and not equivalent. **Not supported**\n6. **Power defines friction = Cf * tm * v**: Reference model's rollingResistance = rollingResistanceCoefficient * mass * 9.81. The generated model uses velocity in friction, which is not physically correct and not equivalent. **Not supported**\n7. **Power returns PowerValue = whlpwr - drag - friction**: Reference model does not subtract drag and friction from power; it computes netForce = drivingForce - totalResistance. Not equivalent. **Not supported**\n\n8. **calc def Acceleration with inputs**: Reference model computes acceleration = netForce / mass. Generated model computes acceleration = tp / (tm * v). \"tp\" is a power, so tp/(tm*v) = power/(mass*velocity) = (force*velocity)/(mass*velocity) = force/mass, so if tp is net force * v, this would be equivalent, but in the generated model, tp is the output of the Power function, which is not net force * v. So, **Not supported**\n9. **Acceleration returns AccelerationValue = tp / (tm * v)**: As above, not equivalent. **Not supported**\n\n10. **calc def Velocity with inputs**: Reference model has updateSpeed(currentSpeed, acceleration, timeStep) = currentSpeed + acceleration * timeStep. **Supported**\n11. **Velocity returns SpeedValue = v0 + a * dt**: Same as above. **Supported**\n\n12. **calc def Position with inputs**: Reference model has updatePosition(currentPosition, speed, timeStep) = currentPosition + speed * timeStep. **Supported**\n13. **Position returns LengthValue = x0 + v * dt**: Same as above. **Supported**\n\n### Part Definition\n14. **part def VehicleDynamics**: Reference model has part def Vehicle.
