The interface WaterDelivery connects these, but does not capture the internal structure, attributes, or actions.\n    - The only claim that is arguably fully covered is the existence of FaucetInlet as a port (claim 5), but its structure (in hotWater, in coldWater) is not specified, so it's not fully covered.\n\n**Therefore, the number of fully covered claims is 0.**\n\n**Total number of claims:** 21\n\n---\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nScore: 0/21**"

Part definition `Vehicle_1` — **Not present** as such; but `Vehicle` is present. Let's see if the structure matches.\n5. Attribute `mass: MassValue = 1200 [kg]` — **Supported** (reference: `mass: Mass = 1200 [kg]`).\n6. Attribute `length: LengthValue = 4.82 [m]` — **Supported** (reference: `length: Length = 4.82 [m]`).\n7. Part `leftFrontWheel: Wheel` — **Not supported** (reference model has `wheelAssemblies: WheelAssembly[4]`, not individual wheels).\n8. Part `rightFrontWheel: Wheel` — **Not supported** (see above).\n\n#### Wheel\n9. Part definition `Wheel` — **Supported**.\n10. Attribute `hubDiameter: LengthValue = 18 ['in']` — **Not supported** (reference model has `rim: Rim` with `diameter: Diameter = 18 [inch]`; not a direct attribute of `Wheel`).\n11. Attribute `width: LengthValue = 245 [mm]` — **Supported** (reference: `Tire` has `width: Width = 245 [mm]`; but in generated model, it's on `Wheel`, not `Tire`).\n12. Attribute `outerDiameter: LengthValue = (hubDiameter + 2 * tire.height) [mm]` — **Partially supported** (reference: `outerDiameter: Diameter = rim.diameter + 2 * tire.height;` in `Wheel`; but in generated model, uses `hubDiameter` instead of `rim.diameter`).\n13. Part `tire: Tire[1]` — **Supported** (reference: `part tire: Tire;` in `Wheel`).\n\n#### Tire\n14. Part definition `Tire` — **Supported**.\n15.

Attribute `height: LengthValue = 45 [mm]` — **Supported** (reference: `height: Height = 45 [mm];` in `Tire`).\n\n#### DiscBrakeConstraint (global constraint)\n18. Constraint definition `DiscBrakeConstraint` — **Supported** (reference: `constraint fitmentConstraint { brakeDisc.diameter < wheel.outerDiameter }` in `WheelAssembly`; similar logic, but in generated model, it's global and uses different names).\n\n#### DiscBrakeFitConstraint_Alt (global constraint)\n19. Constraint definition `DiscBrakeFitConstraint_Alt` — **Supported** (see above).\n\n#### Vehicle_2\n20. Part definition `Vehicle_2` — **Not present** as such; but similar to `Vehicle`.\n21. Attribute `mass: MassValue[1] = 1200 [kg]` — **Supported** (see above).\n22. Attribute `length: LengthValue[1] = 4.82 [m]` — **Supported** (see above).\n23. Part `wheelAssy: WheelAssy[4]` — **Supported** (reference: `wheelAssemblies: WheelAssembly[4];` in `Vehicle`).\n24. Constraint `discBrakeConstraint: DiscBrakeConstraint` — **Supported** (see above).\n\n#### WheelAssy\n25. Part definition `WheelAssy` — **Supported** (reference: `WheelAssembly`).\n26. Part `wheel: Wheel[1]` — **Supported** (reference: `part wheel: Wheel;` in `WheelAssembly`).\n27. Part `discBrakeAssy: DiscBrakeAssy[1]` — **Supported** (reference: `part brakeDisc: BrakeDisc;` in `WheelAssembly`; different name, but same role).\n28. Assert constraint `discBrakeFitConstraint_Alt: DiscBrakeFitConstraint_Alt` — **Supported** (see above).\n\n#### DiscBrakeAssy\n29. Part definition `DiscBrakeAssy` — **Supported** (reference: `BrakeDisc`).\n30. Attribute `radius: LengthValue[1] = 95 [mm]` — **Supported** (reference: `radius: Radius = 95 [mm];` in `BrakeDisc`).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results**\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- **Imports:** 1/3 (only SI::* is supported)\n- **Vehicle_1:** 2/4 (attributes supported, parts not)\n- **Wheel:** 3/5 (part definition, width, tire supported; hubDiameter and outerDiameter not fully supported)\n- **Tire:** 4/4 (all supported)\n- **DiscBrakeConstraint:** 1/1 (supported)\n- **DiscBrakeFitConstraint_Alt:** 1/1 (supported)\n- **Vehicle_2:** 3/4 (attributes and part supported, part definition not)\n- **WheelAssy:** 4/4 (all supported)\n- **DiscBrakeAssy:** 2/2 (both supported)\n\nLet's tally:\n\n- Imports: 1\n- Vehicle_1: 2\n- Wheel: 3\n- Tire: 4\n- DiscBrakeConstraint: 1\n- DiscBrakeFitConstraint_Alt: 1\n- Vehicle_2: 3\n- WheelAssy: 4\n- DiscBrakeAssy: 2\n\nTotal supported: 21\n\nTotal claims: 30\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n**Score: 21/30**",

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n| # | Reference Claim | Covered in Generated Model? | Notes |\n|---|-----------------|----------------------------|-------|\n| 1 | Package 'HeadlampTiltValidation' | **No** | Package is named differently. |\n| 2 | Imports: ISQ, SI, ScalarValues | **Partial** | ISQ and SI are imported, ScalarValues is not. |\n| 3 | Attribute def TiltAngle :> ScalarQuantityValue | **Partial** | LightBeamTiltAngleValue :> PlaneAngleValue (not ScalarQuantityValue, but similar intent). |\n| 4 | TiltAngle has quantityDimension = ISQ::angle | **No** | Not specified. |\n| 5 | TiltAngle has measurementUnit = SI::degree | **Partial** | Constraint uses ['°'], but not as attribute. |\n| 6 | Attribute def ValidationResult | **No** | Not present. |\n| 7 | ValidationResult has isValid: Boolean | **No** | Not present. |\n| 8 | ValidationResult has measuredAngle: TiltAngle | **No** | Not present. |\n| 9 | Port def TiltAnglePort | **No** | Not present. |\n| 10 | TiltAnglePort has in tiltAngle: TiltAngle | **No** | Not present. |\n| 11 | Port def ValidationResultPort | **No** | Not present. |\n| 12 | ValidationResultPort has out validationResult: ValidationResult | **No** | Not present. |\n| 13 | Part headlampTiltValidationSystem | **No** | Not present. |\n| 14 | minValidAngle: TiltAngle = 50 [SI::degree] | **Partial** | Constraint in LightBeamTiltAngleValue covers the range, but not as attribute. |\n| 15 | maxValidAngle: TiltAngle = 80 [SI::degree] | **Partial** | Same as above. |\n| 16 | tiltAnglePort: TiltAnglePort | **No** | Not present. |\n| 17 | validationResultPort: ValidationResultPort | **No** | Not present. |\n| 18 | perform validateTiltAngle | **No** | Not present. |\n| 19 | in tiltAngle = tiltAnglePort.tiltAngle | **No** | Not present. |\n| 20 | out validationResult = validationResultPort.validationResult | **No** | Not present. |\n| 21 | Action validateTiltAngle | **No** | Not present. |\n| 22 | validateTiltAngle in: tiltAngle: TiltAngle | **No** | Not present. |\n| 23 | validateTiltAngle out: validationResult: ValidationResult | **No** | Not present. |\n| 24 | bind validationResult.measuredAngle = tiltAngle | **No** | Not present. |\n| 25 | bind validationResult.isValid = (tiltAngle >= 50 [SI::degree] and tiltAngle <= 80 [SI::degree]) | **Partial** | Constraint in LightBeamTiltAngleValue covers the logic, but not as binding to isValid. |\n\n#### Let's count the covered claims:\n\n- **Full coverage:** None.\n- **Partial coverage:** 3 (claims 2, 3, 5, 14, 15, 25).\n- **No coverage:** The rest.\n\nBut per instructions, a claim is only \"covered\" if the generated model contains the same or equivalent element. Partial coverage (e.g., a constraint instead of an attribute) is only counted if the semantics are equivalent.\n\nLet's be strict:\n\n- Claim 3: LightBeamTiltAngleValue is a subtype of PlaneAngleValue, which is similar to ScalarQuantityValue, but not exactly the same. However, if we accept that PlaneAngleValue is equivalent to ScalarQuantityValue, we can count this as covered.\n- Claim 5: The constraint uses ['°'], which is equivalent to SI::degree.\n- Claims 14, 15, 25: The constraint in LightBeamTiltAngleValue enforces the valid range (50 to 80 degrees), which is the same as the min/max attributes and the isValid logic.\n\nSo, the following claims are covered (by equivalence):\n\n- 3 (TiltAngle type definition)\n- 5 (TiltAngle unit)\n- 14 (minValidAngle)\n- 15 (maxValidAngle)\n- 25 (isValid logic)\n\nClaim 2 (imports) is not a modeling claim per se, unless the imported elements are used, so we can ignore it.\n\n**Total covered claims: 5**\n\n**Total claims in reference: 25**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

StatusLevel :> String with constraint (critical, warning, normal)\n- **Generated model:** `SeverityEnum :> ConditionLevel` with values `danger`, `warning`, `normal`\n    - The names differ (\"danger\" vs \"critical\"), but the structure is similar.\n    - The constraint is implemented as an enum, which is equivalent.\n    - **COVERED** (allowing for naming difference)\n\n#### 5.

passengers, vehicle, gasStation, environment, exitVehicle, and the corresponding use cases/actors/parts)\n- **Partially covered**: 9 (actions like enterVehicle, operateVehicle, transport, provideFuel, requestRefuel, but without explicit attributes/ports/flows)\n- **Not covered**: 25 (all attributes, ports, interfaces, flows, and most port/attribute/flow structure)\n\nFor recall, only **fully covered** claims count. If we count partial coverage as 0.5, then:\n\n- Fully covered: 10\n- Partially covered: 9 × 0.5 = 4.5\n- Total: 14.5/44\n\nBut per instructions, only count as covered if the generated model contains the same or equivalent element (structure and semantics). Since the generated model only covers the existence of actors/parts and use cases (not the structure, attributes, ports, or flows), only the following are covered:\n\n1. Part definition: driver inside context (driver actor)\n2. Part definition: passengers[0..4] inside context (passengers actor)\n3. Part definition: vehicle inside context (vehicle subject)\n4. Part definition: gasStation inside context (fuel station actor)\n5. Part definition: environment inside context (environment actor)\n6.

Action definition: transportation.provideFuel (add fuel use case)\n9. Action definition: transportation.operateVehicle (drive vehicle use case)\n10.

The generated model merges these two steps into one, but the mapping is close. However, since the reference model does not have a direct action from scene to image, this is only partially supported. For this evaluation, let's consider it as supported, since the data types and intent match, and the generated model is a simplification.)\n\n5. **Definition of action Shoot with input image (Image) and output picture (Picture).**  \n   - Not supported (reference model: action executeShoot: in image: Image, out photo: Photo. The types do not match: \"picture\" vs \"photo\".)\n\n6. **Definition of action Display with input picture (Picture).**  \n   - Not supported (reference model: action displayPhoto: in photo: Photo. Again, \"picture\" vs \"photo\".)\n\n7. **Definition of action TakePicture.**  \n   - Not directly supported (reference model has \"triggerTakePhoto\" as the initial action, but not \"TakePicture\" as a type or action. The generated model's \"TakePicture\" is a wrapper for the workflow, which is similar to the reference model's \"photographyWorkflow\" action. Let's consider this as supported.)\n\n8. **Definition of action takePicture as an instance of TakePicture.**  \n   - Supported (reference model: the workflow is defined as an action, so this is equivalent.)\n\n9. **In action takePicture: definition of initial node \"start\".**  \n   - Supported (reference model: the workflow has a starting point, though not explicitly named \"start\".)\n\n10. **In action takePicture: definition of merge node \"continue\".**  \n    - Supported (reference model: the workflow has a sequence of actions; the merge node is a control flow element, which is present in the reference model's succession flows.)\n\n11. **In action takePicture: definition of action \"trigger\" with output scene (Scene).**  \n    - Not supported (reference model: \"triggerTakePhoto\" outputs triggerCmd, not scene. The generated model's \"trigger\" outputs scene, which is not present in the reference model.)\n\n12. **In action takePicture: flow from trigger.scene to focus.scene.**  \n    - Not supported (reference model: flow is from triggerTakePhoto.triggerCmd to acquireScene.triggerCmd, then from acquireScene.scene to performFocus.scene.)\n\n13. **In action takePicture: definition of action \"focus\" as instance of Focus, with input scene and output image.**  \n    - Partially supported (see claim 4; the reference model splits this into two actions, but the data types and intent match. We'll consider this as supported.)\n\n14. **In action takePicture: flow from focus.image to shoot.image.**  \n    - Supported (reference model: flow from generateImage.image to executeShoot.image.)\n\n15. **In action takePicture: definition of action \"shoot\" as instance of Shoot, with input image and output picture.**  \n    - Not supported (reference model: action executeShoot: in image: Image, out photo: Photo. The output type does not match.)\n\n16. **In action takePicture: flow from shoot.picture to display.picture.**  \n    - Not supported (reference model: flow from executeShoot.photo to displayPhoto.photo. The types do not match.)\n\n17. **In action takePicture: definition of action \"display\" as instance of Display, with input picture.**  \n    - Not supported (reference model: action displayPhoto: in photo: Photo. The types do not match.)\n\n18. **In action takePicture: transition to \"continue\" after display.**  \n    - Supported (reference model: the workflow continues after displayPhoto; this is a control flow element.)\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the results.**\n\nLet's count the supported claims:\n\n- Supported: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18 (10 claims)\n- Not supported: 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 (8 claims)\n\n**Score: 10/18**",

A transition to `done`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model\n\n**1. Attribute `TurnKeyToOn`**  \n- **Reference:** The reference model defines an attribute `KeyPosition`, which is used for the key's position (e.g., on/off).  \n- **Assessment:** The generated model's `TurnKeyToOn` is likely intended to represent the same concept as `KeyPosition`. Given the instruction to ignore naming differences if the semantics match, this is **supported**.\n\n**2. Attribute `BrakePressure`**  \n- **Reference:** The reference model defines `BrakePressure`.  \n- **Assessment:** **Supported**.\n\n**3. Action `MonitorBrakePedal` with output `pressure: BrakePressure`**  \n- **Reference:** The reference model has an action `pressBrakePedal` with output `brakePressure: BrakePressure`, and a perform in the driver part.  \n- **Assessment:** The generated model's `MonitorBrakePedal` is equivalent to `pressBrakePedal`. **Supported**.\n\n**4. Action `MonitorTraction` with output `modFreq: Real`**  \n- **Reference:** The reference model has an action `provideTractionInfo` with output `tractionInfo: TractionInfo`, and also an output `modulationFrequency: ModulationFrequency` in `adjustBraking`.  \n- **Assessment:** The generated model conflates traction monitoring with outputting a modulation frequency (type `Real`). In the reference, traction info is a separate attribute, and modulation frequency is produced by `adjustBraking`. There is no action that outputs modulation frequency directly from traction monitoring.  \n- **Supported?** **Not supported**.\n\n**5. Action `Braking` with inputs `brakePressure: BrakePressure` and `modulationFrequency: Real`**  \n- **Reference:** The reference model's `applyBraking` action takes `adjustedBrakePressure` and `modulationFrequency` as inputs. The generated model's `Braking` action takes `brakePressure` and `modulationFrequency`.  \n- **Assessment:** The input `modulationFrequency` matches, but the input `brakePressure` does not match the reference, which expects `adjustedBrakePressure`.  \n- **Supported?** **Not supported**.\n\n**6. Action `Brake` containing:**\n\n- **6a. Action `TurnOn`**  \n  - **Reference:** The reference model has an action `turnKey`.  \n  - **Assessment:** Equivalent. **Supported**.\n\n- **6b. Fork node**  \n  - **Reference:** The reference model does not explicitly model fork/join nodes, but does have parallel flows (e.g., multiple actions performed in parallel).  \n  - **Assessment:** Fork/join nodes are control flow elements, not present in the reference model.  \n  - **Supported?** **Not supported**.\n\n- **6c. Action `monitorBrakePedal: MonitorBrakePedal` with output `brakePressure`**  \n  - **Reference:** As above, matches `pressBrakePedal`. **Supported**.\n\n- **6d. Action `monitorTraction: MonitorTraction` with output `modulationFrequency`**  \n  - **Reference:** As above, no action outputs modulation frequency directly from traction monitoring.  \n  - **Supported?** **Not supported**.\n\n- **6e. Join node**  \n  - **Reference:** Not present. **Not supported**.\n\n- **6f. Flow from `monitorBrakePedal.brakePressure` to `braking.brakePressure`**  \n  - **Reference:** There is a flow from `pressBrakePedal.brakePressure` to `monitorInputs.brakePressure`, and then to `adjustBraking`, but not directly to `applyBraking` (which is the equivalent of `braking`).  \n  - **Assessment:** The generated model skips the intermediate steps. The flow is not directly present, but the information is transferred through the chain.  \n  - **Supported?** **Partially supported**, but since the flow is not direct, **Not supported**.\n\n- **6g. Flow from `monitorTraction.modulationFrequency` to `braking.modulationFrequency`**  \n  - **Reference:** No such flow; modulation frequency is produced by `adjustBraking`, not by traction monitoring.  \n  - **Supported?** **Not supported**.\n\n- **6h. Action `braking: Braking` with inputs `brakePressure` and `modulationFrequency`**  \n  - **Reference:** As above, the reference model's `applyBraking` takes `adjustedBrakePressure` and `modulationFrequency`.  \n  - **Supported?** **Not supported**.\n\n- **6i.

There is a part definition `MassedThing`.\n4. `MassedThing` has an attribute `simpleMass` of type `ISQ::mass`.\n5. `MassedThing` has an attribute `totalMass` of type `ISQ::mass`, with a default value of `simpleMass`.\n\n#### Part: compositeThing\n6. There is a part definition `compositeThing` that specializes (is a subtype of) `MassedThing`.\n7. `compositeThing` has a part `subcomponents` of type `MassedThing[*]` (i.e., 0..* multiplicity).\n8. `compositeThing` has an attribute (derived) `totalMass` with a default value of `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`.\n\n#### Part: filteredMassThing\n9. There is a part definition `filteredMassThing` that specializes (is a subtype of) `compositeThing`.\n10. `filteredMassThing` has an attribute `minMass` of type `ISQ::mass`.\n11. `filteredMassThing` has an attribute (derived) `totalMass` defined as `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass.?{in p:>ISQ::mass; p >= minMass})`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each atomic claim, determine whether it is supported by the reference model.\n\n#### 1. There is a package named `MassRollup`.\n- **Not supported.** The reference model's package is `MassManagementSystem`. (But package naming is not essential for structure, so can be ignored.)\n\n#### 2. The package imports `NumericalFunctions::*`.\n- **Not supported.** No such import in the reference model. (But this is a technicality, not a modeling claim about the system.)\n\n#### 3. There is a part definition `MassedThing`.\n- **Supported.** Equivalent to `MassObject` in the reference model.\n\n#### 4. `MassedThing` has an attribute `simpleMass` of type `ISQ::mass`.\n- **Supported.** Equivalent to `basicMass : Mass` in the reference model.\n\n#### 5. `MassedThing` has an attribute `totalMass` of type `ISQ::mass`, with a default value of `simpleMass`.\n- **Supported.** The reference model computes `totalMass` as the sum of own mass and subcomponent mass; in the base case (no subcomponents), this is just `basicMass`.\n\n#### 6. There is a part definition `compositeThing` that specializes (is a subtype of) `MassedThing`.\n- **Supported.** The reference model's `MassObject` is recursive (has subcomponents of its own type), so this is equivalent.\n\n#### 7. `compositeThing` has a part `subcomponents` of type `MassedThing[*]` (i.e., 0..* multiplicity).\n- **Supported.** The reference model: `part subcomponents : MassObject[0..*];`\n\n#### 8. `compositeThing` has an attribute (derived) `totalMass` with a default value of `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass)`.\n- **Supported.** The reference model's `calculateMass` action sums own mass and subcomponent mass.\n\n#### 9. There is a part definition `filteredMassThing` that specializes (is a subtype of) `compositeThing`.\n- **Supported.** The reference model supports filtering by minimum mass threshold in the `calculateMass` action.\n\n#### 10. `filteredMassThing` has an attribute `minMass` of type `ISQ::mass`.\n- **Supported.** The reference model: `MinMassThreshold` attribute and its use in filtering.\n\n#### 11. `filteredMassThing` has an attribute (derived) `totalMass` defined as `simpleMass + sum(subcomponents.totalMass.?{in p:>ISQ::mass; p >= minMass})`.\n- **Supported.** The reference model's `aggregateSubcomponentMass` action uses a threshold to filter subcomponent masses.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\n- **Atomic claims:** 11\n- **Supported claims:** 9 (claims 3-11)\n- **Not supported:** 2 (claims 1 and 2, which are about package naming and import, not core system modeling)\n\n**Score: 9/11**",

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\nLet's check each claim:\n\n#### A. Attribute/Type Definitions\n1. MessageFormat — **NOT covered** (closest: MessageSchema, but not equivalent)\n2. DataFormat — **NOT covered** (closest: DataSchema, but not equivalent)\n3. ProcessedData — **NOT covered**\n4.

Port Usage in Parts\n15. softwareDesign: port messageFormatPort — **NOT covered**\n16. softwareDesign: port dataFormatPort — **NOT covered**\n17. computerSubsystem: port messageFormatPort — **NOT covered**\n18. computerSubsystem: port dataFormatPort — **NOT covered**\n19. computerSubsystem: port processedDataPort — **NOT covered**\n20. computerSubsystem: port storageRequestPort — **NOT covered**\n21. computerSubsystem: port storageResponsePort — **NOT covered**\n22. storageSubsystem: port messageFormatPort — **NOT covered**\n23. storageSubsystem: port dataFormatPort — **NOT covered**\n24. storageSubsystem: port processedDataPort — **NOT covered**\n25. storageSubsystem: port storageRequestPort — **NOT covered**\n26. storageSubsystem: port storageResponsePort — **NOT covered**\n\n#### E. Actions/Behaviors\n27. softwareDesign: perform systemOperation.defineFormats — **NOT covered**\n28. computerSubsystem: perform systemOperation.integrateAndProcess — **NOT covered**\n29. storageSubsystem: perform systemOperation.accessAndStore — **NOT covered**\n\n#### F. Interfaces/Connections\n30. Interface: softwareToComputer — **NOT covered**\n31. Interface: softwareToComputer2 — **NOT covered**\n32. Interface: softwareToStorage — **NOT covered**\n33.

Succession: storageResponseFlow — **NOT covered**\n\n---\n\n#### Additional possible coverage:\n\n- The generated model defines \"MessageSchema\" and \"DataSchema\" as items in \"Software Design\". These could be considered as partial coverage for \"MessageFormat\" and \"DataFormat\" types, but the names and intent are not strictly equivalent (schema vs format), and the reference model uses \"attribute def\" while the generated model uses \"item def\". Given the instruction to ignore naming if structure and semantics match, but here the semantics are not clearly the same (schema vs format), so **not covered**.\n\n- The generated model defines dependencies from \"Computer Subsystem\" and \"Storage Subsystem\" to \"Software Design\" and its items. This is a very high-level representation of dependency, but does not capture the specific port connections, flows, or actions.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

For partials, let's be strict: only count as covered if the mapping is clear and the semantics are preserved.\n\n- Claim 2: `probability: Real` in `Cause` is not the same as `FailureProbability` as a system attribute, but is related. Let's count as **not covered**.\n- Claim 4: `severity: Level` in `Failure` is similar to `SeverityLevel`, but not as a system attribute. **Not covered**.\n- Claim 7: `battery.power: Real` could be mapped to `currentLevel: BatteryLevel` (if we accept `power` as battery level). Let's count this as **covered**.\n- Claim 10: `battery` in `Device` is similar to `battery: Battery` in `equipment`. Let's count this as **covered**.\n\nSo, only claims 7 and 10 are reasonably covered.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Summarize the results\n\n**Score: 2/31**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nScore: 2/31"

For each atomic claim, determine whether it is covered by the generated model\n\n### A. Attribute Definitions\n\n1. **MassValue**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model uses `ISQ::mass` instead of a user-defined `MassValue` attribute type.\n\n2. **SteeringAngle**  \n   - **Not covered.** The generated model uses `ScalarValues::Real` for `steeringAngle`, not a user-defined `SteeringAngle` type.\n\n### B. Part Definitions\n\n3. **Vehicle**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def Vehicle` exists.\n\n4. **AxleAssembly**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def AxleAssembly` exists.\n\n5. **Axle**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def Axle` exists.\n\n6. **FrontAxle :> Axle**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def FrontAxle :> Axle` exists.\n\n7. **RearAxle :> Axle**  \n   - **Not covered.** Only `FrontAxle` is defined as a specialization; `RearAxle` is missing.\n\n8. **Wheel**  \n   - **Covered.** `part def Wheel` exists.\n\n### C. Vehicle Structure (Vehicle part composition)\n\n9. **Vehicle has attribute mass : MassValue**  \n   - **Partially covered.** `Vehicle` has `mass :> ISQ::mass` (type is different, but semantically similar).  \n   - **Count as covered** (since the attribute and its meaning are present).\n\n10. **Vehicle has part frontAxleAssembly : AxleAssembly**  \n    - **Covered.** Present in both definition and instances.\n\n11. **Vehicle has part rearAxleAssembly : AxleAssembly**  \n    - **Covered.** Present in both definition and instances.\n\n### D. AxleAssembly Structure\n\n12. **AxleAssembly has part axle : Axle**  \n    - **Not covered.** In the generated model, `AxleAssembly` is defined but has no parts in its definition; the parts are only present in the usages/instances.\n\n13. **AxleAssembly has part wheel1 : Wheel**  \n    - **Not covered.** See above.\n\n14. **AxleAssembly has part wheel2 : Wheel**  \n    - **Not covered.** See above.\n\n### E.

Only in `vehicle1_c1` is it `FrontAxle`.\n\n20. **vehicle1.frontAxleAssembly has part leftWheel : wheel1**  \n    - **Not covered.** The generated model uses `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered` and subsetting in `vehicle1_c1`, but not in `vehicle1`. No explicit `leftWheel` or `wheel1`.\n\n21. **vehicle1.frontAxleAssembly has part rightWheel : wheel2**  \n    - **Not covered.** Same as above.\n\n22. **vehicle1 has part rearAxleAssembly**  \n    - **Covered.** Present.\n\n23. **vehicle1.rearAxleAssembly has part axle : RearAxle**  \n    - **Not covered.** In `vehicle1`, `rearAxle: Axle` (not `RearAxle`).\n\n24. **vehicle1.rearAxleAssembly has part leftWheel : wheel1**  \n    - **Not covered.** See above.\n\n25. **vehicle1.rearAxleAssembly has part rightWheel : wheel2**  \n    - **Not covered.** See above.\n\n#### vehicle2\n\n26. **Part vehicle2 : Vehicle**  \n    - **Partially covered.** There is no `vehicle2`, but there is `vehicle1_c1` which is a copy with mass 2000.  \n    - **Count as covered** (semantically equivalent).\n\n27. **vehicle2 has attribute mass = 2000**  \n    - **Covered.** `vehicle1_c1` has `mass = 2000 [kg]`.\n\n28. **vehicle2 has part frontAxleAssembly**  \n    - **Covered.** Present in `vehicle1_c1`.\n\n29. **vehicle2.frontAxleAssembly has part axle : FrontAxle**  \n    - **Covered.** In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontAxle: FrontAxle`.\n\n30. **vehicle2.frontAxleAssembly has part leftWheel : wheel1**  \n    - **Partially covered.** In `vehicle1_c1`, `frontWheel: Wheel[2] ordered` and `frontWheel_1 subsets frontWheel = frontWheel#(1)`. This is a different naming, but the structure is equivalent.  \n    - **Count as covered**.\n\n31. **vehicle2.frontAxleAssembly has part rightWheel : wheel2**  \n    - **Partially covered.** As above, `frontWheel_2 subsets frontWheel = frontWheel#(2)`.  \n    - **Count as covered**.\n\n32. **vehicle2 has part rearAxleAssembly**  \n    - **Covered.** Present in `vehicle1_c1`.\n\n33. **vehicle2.rearAxleAssembly has part axle : RearAxle**  \n    - **Not covered.** In `vehicle1_c1`, `rearAxle: Axle` (not `RearAxle`).\n\n34. **vehicle2.rearAxleAssembly has part leftWheel : wheel1**  \n    - **Partially covered.** `rearWheel_1 subsets rearWheel = rearWheel#(1)`.  \n    - **Count as covered**.\n\n35. **vehicle2.rearAxleAssembly has part rightWheel : wheel2**  \n    - **Partially covered.** `rearWheel_2 subsets rearWheel = rearWheel#(2)`.  \n    - **Count as covered**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
